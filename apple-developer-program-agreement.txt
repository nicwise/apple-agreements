the same criteria:
APIs and Functionality:
3.3.1 Applications may only use Documented APIs in the manner prescribed by Apple and must
not use or call any private APIs.
3.3.2 An Application may not download or install executable code. Interpreted code may only be
used in an Application if all scripts, code and interpreters are packaged in the Application and not
downloaded. The only exception to the foregoing is scripts and code downloaded and run by Apple's builtin
WebKit framework or JavascriptCore, provided that such scripts and code do not change the primary
purpose of the Application by providing features or functionality that are inconsistent with the intended
and advertised purpose of the Application as submitted to the App Store.
3.3.3 Without Apple’s prior written approval or as permitted under Section 3.3.25 (In-App Purchase
API), an Application may not provide, unlock or enable additional features or functionality through
distribution mechanisms other than the App Store or VPP/B2B Program Site.
3.3.4 An Application may only read data from or write data to an Application's designated container
area on the device, except as otherwise specified by Apple.
3.3.5 An Application must have at least the same features and functionality when run by a user in
compatibility mode on an iPad (e.g., an iPhone app running in an equivalent iPhone-size window on an
iPad must perform in substantially the same manner as when run on the iPhone; provided that this
obligation will not apply to any feature or functionality that is not supported by a particular hardware
device, such as a video recording feature on a device that does not have a camera). Further, You agree
not to interfere or attempt to interfere with the operation of Your Application in compatibility mode.
3.3.6 You may use the Multitasking services only for their intended purposes as described in the
Documentation.
User Interface, Data Collection, Local Laws and Privacy:
3.3.7 Applications must comply with the Human Interface Guidelines and other Documentation
provided by Apple.
3.3.8 Any form of user or device data collection, or image, picture or voice capture or recording
(collectively “Recordings”), and any form of data, content or information collection, processing,
maintenance, uploading, syncing, storage, transmission, sharing, disclosure or use performed by, through
or in connection with Your Application must comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations as
well as any related Program Requirements, including but not limited to any notice or consent
requirements. In particular, a reasonably conspicuous audio, visual or other indicator must be displayed
to the user as part of the Application to indicate that a Recording is taking place.
Program Agreement Page 11
3.3.9 You and Your Applications (and any third party with whom You have contracted to serve
advertising) may not collect user or device data without prior user consent, and then only to provide a
service or function that is directly relevant to the use of the Application, or to serve advertising in
accordance with Sections 3.3.12 and 3.3.13. You may not use analytics software in Your Application to
collect and send device data to a third party. Further, neither You nor Your Application will use any
permanent, device-based identifier, or any data derived therefrom, for purposes of uniquely identifying a
device.
3.3.10 You must provide clear and complete information to users regarding Your collection, use and
disclosure of user or device data, e.g., a link to Your privacy policy on the App Store. Furthermore, You
must take appropriate steps to protect such data from unauthorized use, disclosure or access by third
parties. If a user ceases to consent or affirmatively revokes consent for Your collection, use or disclosure
of his or her user or device data, You (and any third party with whom You have contracted to serve
advertising) must promptly cease all such use. In addition, if Your Application accesses the HealthKit,
HomeKit, or Apple Pay APIs, provides keyboard extension functionality, or is primarily intended for use by
children, You must provide a privacy policy to Your end-users explaining Your collection, use, disclosure
and retention of user or device data.
3.3.11 Applications must comply with all applicable criminal, civil and statutory laws and regulations,
including those in any jurisdictions in which Your Applications may be offered or made available. In
addition:
- You and the Application must comply with all applicable privacy and data collection laws and
regulations with respect to any collection, use or disclosure of user or device data.
- Applications may not be designed or marketed for the purpose of harassing, abusing, spamming,
stalking, threatening or otherwise violating the legal rights (such as the rights of privacy and publicity) of
others.
- Neither You nor Your Application may perform any functions or link to any content, services, information
or data or use any robot, spider, site search or other retrieval application or device to scrape, mine,
retrieve, cache, analyze or index software, data or services provided by Apple or its licensors, or obtain
(or try to obtain) any such data, except the data that Apple expressly provides or makes available to You
in connection with such services. You agree that You will not collect, disseminate or use any such data
for any unauthorized purpose.
- If Your Application is intended for human subject research, then You agree to inform participants of the
intended uses and disclosures of their personally identifiable data as part of such research and to obtain
consent from such participants (or their guardians) who will be using Your Application for such research
purposes. Further, You shall prohibit third parties to whom you provide any de-identified or coded data
from re-identifying (or attempting to re-identify) any participants using such data without participant
consent, and You agree to require that such third parties pass the foregoing restriction on to any other
parties who receive such de-identified or coded data.
Advertising Identifier:
3.3.12 You and Your Applications (and any third party with whom You have contracted to serve
advertising) may use the Advertising Identifier, and any information obtained through the use of the
Advertising Identifier, only for the purpose of serving advertising. If a user resets the Advertising
Identifier, then You agree not to combine, correlate, link or otherwise associate, either directly or
indirectly, the prior Advertising Identifier and any derived information with the reset Advertising Identifier.
Advertising Preference:
3.3.13 For Applications compiled for any iOS version providing access to the Ad Support APIs:
- You agree to check a user’s Advertising Preference prior to serving any advertising using the
Advertising Identifier, and You agree to abide by a user’s setting in the Advertising Preference.
Program Agreement Page 12
- If a user has set their Advertising Preference to limit ad tracking, You may use the Advertising Identifier,
and any information obtained through the use of the Advertising Identifier, only for Limited Advertising
Purposes.
Location and Maps; User Consents:
3.3.14 For Applications that use location-based APIs (e.g., Core Location, Map Kit API) or otherwise
provide location-based services, such Applications may not be designed or marketed for automatic or
autonomous control of vehicle behavior, or for emergency or life-saving purposes. In addition,
Applications that offer location-based services or functionality must notify and obtain consent from an
individual before his or her location data is collected, transmitted or otherwise used by the Application.
3.3.15 If You choose to provide Your own location-based service, data and/or information in
conjunction with the Apple maps provided through the Apple Maps Service (e.g., overlaying a map or
route You have created on top of an Apple map), You are solely responsible for ensuring that Your
service, data and/or information correctly aligns with any Apple maps used. For Applications that use
location-based APIs for real-time navigation (including, but not limited to, turn-by-turn route guidance and
other routing that is enabled through the use of a sensor), You must have an end-user license agreement
that includes the following notice: YOUR USE OF THIS REAL TIME ROUTE GUIDANCE APPLICATION
IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. LOCATION DATA MAY NOT BE ACCURATE.
3.3.16 Applications must not disable, override or otherwise interfere with any Apple-implemented
system alerts, warnings, display panels, consent panels and the like, including, but not limited to, those
that are intended to notify the user that the user's location data, address book data, calendar, photos,
and/or reminders are being collected, transmitted, maintained, processed or used, or intended to obtain
consent for such use. If consent is denied or withdrawn, Applications may not collect, transmit, maintain,
process or utilize such data or perform any other actions for which the user’s consent has been denied or
withdrawn.
3.3.17 If Your Application uses or accesses the Map Kit API from a device running iOS version 6 or
later, Your Application will access and use the Apple Maps Service. All use of the Map Kit API and Apple
Maps Service will be in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (including the Program
Requirements) and Attachment 6 (Additional Terms for the use of the Apple Maps Service). If Your
Application uses or accesses the Map Kit API from a device running iOS version 5 or earlier, Your
Application will access and use the Google Mobile Maps (GMM) service. Such use of the GMM Service
is subject to Google’s Terms of Service which are set forth
at: http://code.google.com/apis/maps/terms/iPhone.html. If You do not accept such Google Terms of
Service, including, but not limited to all limitations and restrictions therein, You may not use the GMM
service in Your Application, and You acknowledge and agree that such use will constitute Your
acceptance of such Terms of Service.
Content and Materials:
3.3.18 Any master recordings and musical compositions embodied in Your Application must be
wholly-owned by You or licensed to You on a fully paid-up basis and in a manner that will not require the
payment of any fees, royalties and/or sums by Apple to You or any third party. In addition, if Your
Application will be distributed outside of the United States, any master recordings and musical
compositions embodied in Your Application (a) must not fall within the repertoire of any mechanical or
performing/communication rights collecting or licensing organization now or in the future and (b) if
licensed, must be exclusively licensed to You for Your Application by each applicable copyright owner.
3.3.19 If Your Application includes or will include any other content, You must either own all such
content or have permission from the content owner to use it in Your Application.
3.3.20 Applications may be rejected if they contain content or materials of any kind (text, graphics,
images, photographs, sounds, etc.) that in Apple’s reasonable judgment may be found objectionable or
inappropriate, for example, materials that may be considered obscene, pornographic, or defamatory.
Program Agreement Page 13
3.3.21 Applications must not contain any malware, malicious or harmful code, program, or other
internal component (e.g., computer viruses, trojan horses, “backdoors”) which could damage, destroy, or
adversely affect the Apple Software, services, iOS Products or other software, firmware, hardware, data,
systems, services, or networks.
3.3.22 If Your Application includes any FOSS, You agree to comply with all applicable FOSS
licensing terms. You also agree not to use any FOSS in the development of Your Application in such a
way that would cause the non-FOSS portions of the Apple Software to be subject to any FOSS licensing
terms or obligations.
3.3.23 Your Application may include promotional sweepstake or contest functionality provided that
You are the sole sponsor of the promotion and that You and Your Application comply with any applicable
laws and fulfill any applicable registration requirements in the country or territory where You make Your
Application available and the promotion is open. You agree that You are solely responsible for any
promotion and any prize, and also agree to clearly state in binding official rules for each promotion that
Apple is not a sponsor of, or responsible for conducting, the promotion.
3.3.24 Your Application may include a direct link to a page on Your web site where You include the
ability for an end-user to make a charitable contribution, provided that You comply with any applicable
laws (which may include providing a receipt), and fulfill any applicable regulation or registration
requirements, in the country or territory where You enable the charitable contribution to be made. You
also agree to clearly state that Apple is not the fundraiser.
In-App Purchase API:
3.3.25 All use of the In-App Purchase API and related services must be in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement (including the Program Requirements) and Attachment 2 (Additional Terms for
Use of the In-App Purchase API).
Advertising API:
3.3.26 If You choose to use the Advertising API in Your Application, then You must enter into a
separate written agreement with Apple and/or an Apple Subsidiary before any distribution of Your
Licensed Application may take place via the App Store, VPP/B2B Program Site, or TestFlight Program.
iOS Accessories:
3.3.27 Your Application may interface, communicate, or otherwise interoperate with or control an
iOS Accessory (as defined above) through Bluetooth or Apple's 30-pin dock connector only if (i) such iOS
Accessory is licensed under Apple's MFi Licensing Program at the time that You initially submit Your
Application, (ii) the MFi Licensee has added Your Application to a list of those approved for
interoperability with their iOS Accessory, and (iii) the MFi Licensee has received approval from the Apple
MFi Licensing Program for such addition.
Regulatory Compliance:
3.3.28 You will fulfill any applicable regulatory requirements, including full compliance with all
applicable laws, regulations, and policies related to the manufacturing, marketing, sale and distribution of
Your Application in the United States, and in particular the requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration ("FDA") as well as other U.S. regulatory bodies such as the FAA, HHS, FTC, and FCC,
and the laws, regulations and policies of any other applicable regulatory bodies in any countries or
territories where You use or make Your Application available, e.g., MHRA, CFDA. However, You agree
that You will not seek any regulatory marketing permissions or make any determinations that may result
in any Apple products being deemed regulated or that may impose any obligations or limitations on
Apple. By submitting Your Application to Apple for selection for distribution, You represent and warrant
that You are in full compliance with any applicable laws, regulations, and policies, including but not limited
to all FDA laws, regulations and policies, related to the manufacturing, marketing, sale and distribution of
Your Application in the United States, as well as in other countries or territories where You plan to make
Program Agreement Page 14
Your Application available. You also represent and warrant that You will market Your Application only for
its cleared or approved intended use/indication for use, and only in strict compliance with applicable
regulatory requirements. Upon Apple’s request, You agree to promptly provide any such clearance
documentation to support the marketing of Your Application. If requested by the FDA or by another
government body that has a need to review or test Your Application as part of its regulatory review
process, You may provide Your Application to such entity for review purposes. You agree to promptly
notify Apple in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 15.5 of any complaints or threats of
complaints regarding Your Application in relation to any such regulatory requirements, in which case
Apple may remove Your Application from distribution.
Cellular Network:
3.3.29 If an Application requires or will have access to the cellular network, then additionally such
Application:
- Must comply with Apple's best practices and other guidelines on how Applications should access and
use the cellular network; and
- Must not in Apple's reasonable judgment excessively use or unduly burden network capacity or
bandwidth.
3.3.30 Because some mobile network operators may prohibit or restrict the use of Voice over
Internet Protocol (VoIP) functionality over their network, such as the use of VoIP telephony over a cellular
network, and may also impose additional fees, or other charges in connection with VoIP, You agree to
inform end-users, prior to purchase, to check the terms of agreement with their operator, for example, by
providing such notice in the marketing text that You provide accompanying Your Application on the App
Store. In addition, if Your Application allows end-users to send SMS messages, then You must inform
the end-user, prior to use of such functionality, that standard text messaging rates or other carrier
charges may apply to such use.
APN (Apple Push Notification service) and Local Notifications:
3.3.31 All use of Push Notifications via the APN or Local Notifications must be in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement (including the Program Requirements) and Attachment 1 (Additional Terms
for Apple Push Notification service and Local Notifications).
Game Center:
3.3.32 All use of the Game Center must be in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
(including the Program Requirements) and Attachment 3 (Additional Terms for the Game Center).
iCloud:
3.3.33 All use of the iCloud Storage APIs and CloudKit APIs, as well as Your use of the iCloud
service under this Agreement, must be in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (including the
Program Requirements) and Attachment 4 (Additional Terms for the use of iCloud).
Passbook:
3.3.34 Your development of Passes, and use of the Pass Type ID and Passbook under this
Agreement, must be in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (including the Program
Requirements) and Attachment 5 (Additional Terms for Passes).
Additional Services or End-User Pre-Release Software:
3.3.35 From time to time, Apple may provide access to additional services or pre-release Apple
Software for You to use in connection with Your Applications, or as an end-user for evaluation purposes.
Some of these may be subject to separate terms and conditions in addition to this Agreement, in which
Program Agreement Page 15
case Your usage will also be subject to those terms and conditions. Such services or software may not
be available in all languages or in all countries, and Apple makes no representation that they will be
appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent You choose to access such
services or software, You do so at Your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any
applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws. To the extent any such software
includes Apple’s FaceTime or Messages feature, You acknowledge and agree that when You use such
features, the telephone numbers and device identifiers associated with Your Authorized Test Devices, as
well as email addresses and/or Apple ID information You provide, may be used and maintained by Apple
to provide and improve such software and features. Certain services made accessible to You through the
Apple Software may be provided by third parties. You acknowledge that Apple will not have any liability or
responsibility to You or any other person (including to any end-user) for any third-party services or for any
Apple services. Apple and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access
to any services at any time. In no event will Apple be liable for the removal of or disabling of access to
any such services. Further, upon any commercial release of such software or services, or earlier if
requested by Apple, You agree to cease all use of the pre-release Apple Software or services provided to
You as an end-user for evaluation purposes under this Agreement.
3.3.36 If Your Application accesses the Twitter service through the Twitter API, such access is
subject to Twitter terms of service set forth at: http://dev.twitter.com. If You do not accept such Twitter
terms of service, including, but not limited to all limitations and restrictions therein, You may not access
the Twitter service in Your Application through the use of the Twitter API, and You acknowledge and
agree that such use will constitute Your acceptance of such terms of service.
3.3.37 If Your Application accesses data from an end-user’s Address Book through the Address
Book API, You must notify and obtain consent from the user before his or her Address Book data is
accessed or used by Your Application. Further, Your Application may not provide an automated
mechanism that transfers only the Facebook Data portions of the end-user’s Address Book altogether to
a location off of the end-user’s device. For the sake of clarity, this does not prohibit an automated
transfer of the user’s entire Address Book as a whole, so long as user notification and consent
requirements have been fulfilled; and does not prohibit enabling users to transfer any portion of their
Address Book data manually (e.g., by cutting and pasting) or enabling them to individually select
particular data items to be transferred.
Extensions, WatchKit Extensions and Keyboard extensions:
3.3.38 Applications that include extensions in the Application bundle must provide some functionality
beyond just the extensions (e.g., help screens, additional settings), unless an Application includes a
WatchKit Extension. In addition:
- Extensions (excluding WatchKit Extensions) may not include advertising, product promotion, direct
marketing, or In-App Purchase offers in their extension view;
- Extensions may not block the full screen of an iOS Product or redirect, obstruct or interfere in an
undisclosed or unexpected way with a user’s use of another developer’s application or any Appleprovided
functionality or service;
- Extensions may operate only in Apple-designated areas of iOS or Watch OS as set forth in the
Documentation;
- Extensions that provide keyboard functionality must be capable of operating independent of any
network access and must include Unicode characters (vs. pictorial images only); and
- Any keystroke logging done by any such extension must be clearly disclosed to the end-user prior to
any such data being sent from an iOS Product, and notwithstanding anything else in Section 3.3.9, such
data may be used only for purposes of providing or improving the keyboard functionality of Your
Application (e.g., not for serving advertising).
HealthKit APIs
Program Agreement Page 16
3.3.39 Your Application must not access the HealthKit APIs unless it is primarily designed to provide
health and/or fitness services, and this usage is clearly evident in Your marketing text and user interface.
In addition:
- Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 3.3.9, You and Your Application may not use the
HealthKit APIs, or any information obtained through the HealthKit APIs, for any purpose other than
providing health and/or fitness services in connection with Your Application (e.g., not for serving
advertising).
- You must not use the HealthKit APIs, or any information obtained through the HealthKit APIs, to
disclose or provide an end-user’s health and/or fitness information to a third party without express enduser
consent, and then only for purposes of enabling the third party to provide health and/or fitness
services. For example, You must not share or sell an end-user’s health information collected through the
HealthKit APIs to advertising platforms, data brokers or information resellers. For clarity, You may allow
end-users to consent to share their data with third parties for medical research purposes.
- You agree to clearly disclose to end-users how You and Your Application will be using their health
and/or fitness information and to use it only as expressly consented to by the end-user and as expressly
permitted herein.
3.3.40 If Your Application accesses NikeFuel points information through the HealthKit APIs, then
Your use of the NikeFuel points information is subject to the NikeFuel points terms of service set forth at:
https://developer.nike.com/healthkit/nikefuel-use-agreement.html. If You do not accept such NikeFuel
terms of service, including, but not limited to all limitations and restrictions therein, You may not use such
NikeFuel points information in Your Application, and You acknowledge and agree that such use will
constitute Your acceptance of such terms of service.
HomeKit APIs:
3.3.41 Your Application must not access the HomeKit APIs unless it is primarily designed to provide
home configuration or home automation services (e.g., turning on a light, lifting a garage door) for
Licensed HomeKit Accessories and this usage is clearly evident in Your marketing text and user
interface. You agree not to use the HomeKit APIs for any purpose other than interfacing, communicating,
interoperating with or otherwise controlling a Licensed HomeKit Accessory or for using the HomeKit
Database, and then only for home configuration or home automation purposes in connection with Your
Application.
- Your Application may use information obtained from the HomeKit APIs and/or the HomeKit Database
only on an iOS Product and may not export, remotely access or transfer such information off a device
(e.g., a lock password cannot be sent off an end-user’s device to be stored in an external non-Apple
database).
- Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 3.3.9, You and Your Application may not use the
HomeKit APIs, or any information obtained through the HomeKit APIs or through the HomeKit Database,
for any purpose other than providing or improving home configuration or home automation services in
connection with Your Application (e.g., not for serving advertising).
Apple Pay APIs:
3.3.42 Your Application may use the Apple Pay APIs solely for the purpose of facilitating payment
transactions that are made through Your Application, and only for the purchase of goods and services
that are to be used outside of any iOS Product or Apple Watch. For clarity, nothing in this Section 3.3.42
supplants any of the rules or requirements for the use of the In-App Purchase API, including but not
limited to Section 3.3.3 and the guidelines. In addition:
- You acknowledge and agree that Apple is not a party to any payment transactions facilitated through
the use of the Apple Pay APIs and is not responsible for any such transactions, including but not limited
Program Agreement Page 17
to the unavailability of any end-user payment cards or payment fraud. Such payment transactions are
between You and Your bank, acquirer, card networks, or other parties You utilize
for transaction processing, and You are responsible for complying with any agreements You have with
such third parties. In some cases, such agreements may contain terms specifying specific rights,
obligations or limitations that You accept and assume in connection with Your decision to utilize the
functionality of the Apple Pay APIs.
- You agree to store any private keys provided to You as part of Your use of the Apple Pay APIs in a
secure manner (e.g., encrypted on a server) and in accordance with the Documentation. You agree not
to store any end-user payment information in an unencrypted manner on an iOS Product. For clarity, You
may not decrypt any such end-user payment information on an iOS Product.
- You agree not to call the Apple Pay APIs or otherwise attempt to gain information through the Apple
Pay APIs for purposes unrelated to facilitating end-user payment transactions. For example, if You
receive an end-user’s zip code through the Apple Pay APIs before an order is submitted, then You agree
to use such information only for purposes of calculating tax and shipping for the transaction and not to
use or retain it for any other purposes.
4. Changes to Program Requirements or Terms
Apple may change the Program Requirements or the terms of this Agreement at any time. New or
modified Program Requirements will not retroactively apply to Applications already in distribution. In order
to continue using the Apple Software or any services, You must accept and agree to the new Program
Requirements and/or new terms of this Agreement. If You do not agree to new Program Requirements or
new terms, Your use of the Apple Software and any services will be suspended or terminated by Apple.
You agree that Your acceptance of such new Agreement terms or Program Requirements may be
signified electronically, including without limitation, by Your checking a box or clicking on an “agree” or
similar button. Nothing in this Section shall affect Apple's rights under Section 8 below.
5. Digital Signing; Restrictions on Certificates
5.1 Certificate Requirements
All Applications must be signed with an Apple-issued certificate in order to be installed on Registered
Devices or submitted to Apple. All Passes must be signed with a Pass Type ID to be recognized and
accepted by Passbook. All Safari Extensions must be signed with an Apple-issued certificate to run in
Safari on OS X. You must use a Website ID to send OS X Website Push Notifications to the OS X
desktop of users who have opted in to receive such Notifications for Your Site through Safari on OS X.
During the Term of this Agreement, You may obtain development-related digital certificates from Apple,
subject to a maximum number as reasonably determined by Apple, that will allow Your Application and
Your Pass to be installed and tested on Authorized Test Devices. You may also obtain, during the Term,
one or more production digital certificates from Apple, subject to a maximum number as reasonably
determined by Apple, to be used for the sole purpose of signing Your Application(s) prior to submission of
Your Application to Apple or limited distribution of Your Application for use on Registered Devices. You
may also obtain Apple-issued certificates to sign Your Safari Extensions for distribution purposes as set
forth herein.
In relation to this, You represent and warrant to Apple that: (a) You will not take any action to interfere
with the normal operation of any Apple-issued digital certificates or Provisioning Profiles; (b) You are
solely responsible for preventing any unauthorized person from having access to Your digital certificates
and corresponding private keys and You will use best efforts to safeguard Your digital certificates and
corresponding private keys from compromise; (c) You agree to immediately notify Apple in writing if You
have any reason to believe there has been a compromise of any of Your digital certificates or
corresponding private keys; (d) You will not provide or transfer Apple-issued digital certificates provided
under this Program to any third party, nor use Your digital certificate to sign any third party's application,
pass, extension or site, except when providing them to a contractor who is developing an Application,
Pass, Safari Extension or Site for You in compliance with the terms of this Agreement; and (e) You will
use Apple-issued certificates provided under this Program exclusively for the purpose of signing Your
Passes, signing Your Safari Extensions, signing Your Site’s registration bundle, accessing the APN
Program Agreement Page 18
service, and/or signing Your Applications for testing, submission to Apple and/or for limited distribution for
use on Registered Devices as contemplated under this Program, and only in accordance with this
Agreement.
You further represent and warrant to Apple that the licensing terms governing Your Application, Your
Safari Extension, Your Site’s registration bundle and/or Your Pass, or governing any third party code or
FOSS included therein, will be consistent with and not conflict with the digital signing or content protection
aspects of the Program or any of the terms, conditions or requirements of the Program or this Agreement.
In particular, such licensing terms will not purport to require Apple (or its agents) to disclose or make
available any of the keys, authorization codes, methods, procedures, data or other information related to
the Security Solution, digital signing or digital rights management mechanisms utilized as part of the
Program. If You discover any such inconsistency or conflict, You agree to immediately notify Apple of it
and will cooperate with Apple to resolve such matter. You acknowledge and agree that Apple may
immediately cease distribution of any affected Licensed Applications or Passes, and may refuse to accept
any subsequent Application or Pass submissions from You until such matter is resolved to Apple’s
reasonable satisfaction.
5.2 Additional Safari Extension Requirements
If You would like to distribute Your Safari Extension signed with an Apple-issued digital certificate, then
You agree to the following requirements for such Safari Extension, as they may be modified by Apple
from time to time:
- Your Safari Extension must not contain any malware, malicious or harmful code, or other internal
component (e.g. computer viruses, trojan horses, “backdoors”) which could damage, destroy, or
adversely affect Apple hardware, software or services, or other third party software, firmware, hardware,
data, systems, services, or networks.
- Your Safari Extensions must not be designed or marketed for the purpose of harassing, abusing,
stalking, spamming, threatening or otherwise violating the legal rights (such as the rights of privacy and
publicity) of others.
- Your Safari Extension must only operate in Safari on OS X's designated container area for the Safari
Extension, and must not disable, override or otherwise interfere with any Apple-implemented system
alerts, warnings, display panels, consent panels and the like.

- Your Safari Extensions must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including those in any
jurisdictions in which such Safari Extensions may be offered or made available.
6. Application Submission and Selection
6.1 Submission to Apple for App Store or VPP/B2B Distribution
You may submit Your Application for consideration by Apple for distribution via the App Store or VPP/B2B
Program Site once You decide that Your Application has been adequately tested and is complete. By
submitting Your Application, You represent and warrant that Your Application complies with the
Documentation and Program Requirements then in effect as well as with any additional guidelines that
Apple may post on the Program web portal or in iTunes Connect. You further agree that You will not
attempt to hide, misrepresent or obscure any features, content, services or functionality in Your submitted
Applications from Apple's review or otherwise hinder Apple from being able to fully review such
Applications. In addition, You agree to inform Apple in writing through iTunes Connect if Your Application
connects to a physical device, including an iOS Accessory, and, if so, to disclose the means of such
connection (whether iAP, the headphone jack, or any other communication protocol or standard) and
identify at least one physical device with which Your Application is designed to communicate. If
requested by Apple, You agree to provide access to or samples of any such devices at Your expense
(samples will not be returned). You agree to cooperate with Apple in this submission process and to
answer questions and provide information and materials reasonably requested by Apple regarding Your
submitted Application, including insurance information You may have relating to Your Application, the
operation of Your business, or Your obligations under this Agreement. Apple may require You to carry
certain levels of insurance for certain types of Applications and name Apple as an additional insured.
Program Agreement Page 19
If You make any changes to an Application (including to any functionality made available through use of
the In-App Purchase API) after submission to Apple, You must resubmit the Application to Apple.
Similarly all bug fixes, updates, upgrades, modifications, enhancements, supplements to, revisions, new
releases and new versions of Your Application must be submitted to Apple for review in order for them to
be considered for distribution via the App Store or VPP/B2B Program Site.
6.2 Submission to Apple for the TestFlight Program
If You would like to distribute Your Application to Beta Testers through the TestFlight Program, You must
first submit Your Application to Apple for review. By submitting such Application, You represent and
warrant that Your Application complies with the Documentation and Program Requirements then in effect
as well as with any additional guidelines that Apple may post on the Program web portal or in iTunes
Connect. Thereafter, Apple may permit You to distribute updates to such Application directly to Your
Beta Testers without Apple’s review, unless such an update includes significant changes, in which case
You agree to inform Apple in iTunes Connect and have such Application re-reviewed. Apple reserves the
right to require You to cease distribution of Your Application through the TestFlight Program, and/or to
any particular Beta Tester, at any time in its sole discretion.
6.3 Improving Your Application
Further, if Your Application is accepted for distribution via the App Store, VPP/B2B Program Site or
TestFlight Program, You agree that Apple may use Your Application for the limited purpose of
compatibility testing of Your Application with Apple products and services, for finding and fixing bugs in
Apple products and services, for internal use in evaluating iOS or Watch OS performance issues in Your
Application, and for purposes of providing other information to You (e.g., crash logs). You may opt in to
send app symbol information for Your Application to Apple, and if You do so, then You agree that Apple
may use such symbols to symbolicate Your Application for purposes of providing You with symbolicated
crash logs. In the event that Apple provides You with crash logs or other diagnostic information for Your
Application, You agree to use such crash logs and information only for purposes of fixing bugs and
improving the performance of Your Application and related products. You may also collect numeric
strings and variables from Your Application when it crashes, so long as You collect such information only
in an anonymous, non-personal manner and do not recombine, correlate, or use such information to
attempt to identify or derive information about any particular end-user or device.
6.4 Analytics
To the extent that Apple provides an analytics service, You agree to use any data provided through such
service solely for purposes of improving Your Applications and related products. Further, You agree not
to provide such information to any third parties (except for a third-party service provider who is assisting
You in processing and analyzing such data on Your behalf and who is not permitted to use it for any other
purpose or disclose it to any other party). For clarity, You must not aggregate (or permit any third-party to
aggregate) analytics information provided to You by Apple for Your Applications as part of this service
with other developers’ analytics information, or contribute such information to a repository for crossdeveloper
analytics. You must not use the analytics service or any analytics data to attempt to identify or
derive information about any particular end-user or device.
6.5 Selection by Apple for Distribution
You understand and agree that Apple may, in its sole discretion:
(a) determine that Your Application does not meet all or any part of the Documentation or Program
Requirements then in effect;
(b) reject Your Application for distribution for any reason, even if Your Application meets the
Documentation and Program Requirements; or
(c) select and digitally sign Your Application for distribution via the App Store, VPP/B2B Program Site, or
TestFlight Program.
Apple shall not be responsible for any costs, expenses, damages, losses (including without limitation lost
business opportunities or lost profits) or other liabilities You may incur as a result of Your Application
development, use of this Apple Software, use of any services, certificates or APIs provided hereunder, or
participation in the Program, including without limitation the fact that Your Application may not be selected
for distribution via the App Store or VPP/B2B Program Site. You will be solely responsible for developing
Program Agreement Page 20
Applications that are safe, free of defects in design and operation, and comply with applicable laws and
regulations. You will also be solely responsible for any documentation and end-user customer support
and warranty of Your Applications. The fact that Apple may have reviewed, tested, approved or selected
an Application will not relieve You of any of these responsibilities.
7. Distribution of Applications and Libraries
Applications:
Applications developed under this Agreement may be distributed in four ways: (1) through the App Store,
if selected by Apple, (2) through the VPP/B2B Program Site, if selected by Apple, (3) through Ad Hoc
distribution in accordance with Section 7.2, and (4) for beta testing through Apple’s TestFlight Program in
accordance with Section 7.3.
7.1 Delivery of Freely Available Licensed Applications via the App Store; Certificates
If Your Application qualifies as a Licensed Application, it is eligible for delivery to end-users via the App
Store by Apple and/or an Apple Subsidiary. If You would like Apple and/or an Apple Subsidiary to deliver
Your Licensed Application or authorize additional content, functionality or services You make available in
Your Licensed Application through the use of the In-App Purchase API to end-users for free (no charge)
via the App Store, then You appoint Apple and Apple Subsidiaries as Your legal agent pursuant to the
terms of Schedule 1, for Licensed Applications designated by You as free of charge applications.
If Your Application qualifies as a Licensed Application and You intend to charge end-users a fee of any
kind for Your Licensed Application or within Your Licensed Application through the use of the In-App
Purchase API, You must enter into a separate agreement (Schedule 2) with Apple and/or an Apple
Subsidiary before any such commercial distribution of Your Licensed Application may take place via the
App Store or before any such commercial delivery of additional content, functionality or services for which
You charge end-users a fee may be authorized through the use of the In-App Purchase API in Your
Licensed Application.
If Your Application qualifies as a Custom B2B Application, then You must enter into a separate
agreement (Schedule 3) with Apple and/or an Apple Subsidiary before any distribution of Your Custom
B2B Application to VPP Customers may take place via the VPP/B2B Program Site. To the extent that
You enter (or have previously entered) into Schedule 2 or Schedule 3 with Apple and/or an Apple
Subsidiary, the terms of Schedule 2 or 3 will be deemed incorporated into this Agreement by this
reference.
When an end-user installs Your Licensed Application, Apple will provide You with a transaction receipt
signed with an Apple-issued certificate. It is Your responsibility to verify that such certificate and receipt
were issued by Apple, as set forth in the Documentation. You are solely responsible for Your decision to
rely on any such certificates and receipts. YOUR USE OF OR RELIANCE ON SUCH CERTIFICATES
AND RECEIPTS IN CONNECTION WITH A PURCHASE OF AN APPLICATION IS AT YOUR SOLE
RISK. APPLE MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY,
SECURITY, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH
DIGITAL CERTIFICATES AND RECEIPTS. You agree that You will only use such receipts and
certificates in accordance with the Documentation, and that You will not interfere or tamper with the
normal operation of such digital certificates or receipts, including but not limited to any falsification or
other misuse.
7.2 Distribution on Registered Devices (Ad Hoc Distribution)
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You may also distribute Your Applications to
individuals within Your company, organization, educational institution, group, or who are otherwise
affiliated with You for use solely on a limited number of Registered Devices (as specified on the Program
web portal), if Your Application has been digitally signed using Your Apple-issued digital certificate as
described in this Agreement. By distributing Your Application in this manner, You represent and warrant
to Apple that Your Application complies with the Documentation and Program Requirements then in effect
and You agree to cooperate with Apple and to answer questions and provide information about Your
Application, as reasonably requested by Apple.
Program Agreement Page 21
You also agree to be solely responsible for determining which individuals within Your company,
organization, educational institution or affiliated group should have access to and use of Your
Applications and Registered Devices, and for managing such Registered Devices. Apple shall not be
responsible for any costs, expenses, damages, losses (including without limitation lost business
opportunities or lost profits) or other liabilities You may incur as a result of distributing Your Applications in
this manner, or for Your failure to adequately manage, limit or otherwise control the access to and use of
Your Applications and Registered Devices.
You will be responsible for attaching or otherwise including, at Your discretion, any relevant usage terms
with Your Applications. Apple will not be responsible for any violations of Your usage terms. You will be
solely responsible for all user assistance, warranty and support of Your Applications.
7.3 Distribution via Apple’s TestFlight Program
A. Internal Distribution to Authorized Developers
You may use the TestFlight Program for internal distribution of pre-release versions of Your Applications
to a limited number of Your Authorized Developers, but solely for their use in testing and developing Your
Applications. Apple reserves the right to require You to cease distribution of such Applications to Your
Authorized Developers through the TestFlight Program, or to any particular Authorized Developer, at any
time in its sole discretion.
B. Distribution to Beta Testers
You may use the TestFlight Program for external distribution of pre-release versions of Your Applications
to a limited number of Beta Testers (as specified in iTunes Connect), but solely for their testing and
evaluation of such pre-release versions of Your Applications. You may not charge Your Beta Testers
fees of any kind to participate in Apple’s TestFlight Program or for the use of any such pre-release
versions. Further, You may not use the TestFlight Program for purposes that are not related to improving
the quality, performance, or usability of pre-release versions of Your Application (e.g., continuous
distribution of demo versions of Your Application in an attempt to circumvent the App Store or providing
trial versions of Your Applications for purposes of soliciting favorable App Store ratings are prohibited
uses). Further, if Your Application is primarily intended for children, You must verify that Your Beta
Testers are of the age of majority in their jurisdiction. If You choose to add Beta Testers to the TestFlight
Program, then You are assuming responsibility for any invitations sent to such end-users and for
obtaining their consent to contact them. If a Beta Tester requests that You stop contacting them (either
through the TestFlight Program or otherwise), then You agree to promptly do so.
C. Use of TestFlight Program Information
To the extent that the TestFlight Program provides You with beta analytics information about Your
Authorized Developer’s or Beta Tester’s use of pre-release versions of Your Application (e.g., installation
time, frequency of an individual’s use of an App, etc.) and/or other related information, You agree to use
such data solely for purposes of improving Your Applications and related products. You agree not to
provide such information to any third parties (except for a third-party service provider who is assisting You
in processing and analyzing such data on Your behalf and who is not permitted to use it for any other
purpose or disclose it to any other party). For clarity, You must not aggregate (or permit any third-party to
aggregate) beta analytics information provided to You by Apple for Your Applications as part of this
TestFlight Program with other developers’ beta analytics information, or contribute such information to a
repository for cross-developer beta analytics information. Further, You must not use any beta analytics
information provided through the TestFlight Program for purposes of de-anonymizing information
obtained from or regarding a particular device or end-user outside of the TestFlight Program (e.g., You
may not attempt to connect data gathered through the TestFlight Program for a particular end-user with
information that is provided in an anonymized form through Apple’s analytics service).
Libraries:
7.4 Distribution of Libraries for use with iOS Products or Apple Watch only
You may develop Libraries using the iOS SDK under this Agreement, provided any such Libraries are
developed and distributed solely for use with an iOS Product or Apple Watch, and You limit use of such
Libraries only to use with iOS Products or Apple Watch. If Apple determines that Your Library is not
Program Agreement Page 22
designed for use only with iOS Products or Apple Watch, then Apple may require You to cease
distribution of Your Library at any time, and You agree to promptly cease all distribution of such Library
upon notice from Apple and cooperate with Apple to remove any remaining copies of such Library.
7.5 No Other Distribution Authorized Under this Agreement
Except for the distribution of freely available Licensed Applications through the App Store or VPP/B2B
Program Site in accordance with Section 7.1, the distribution of Applications for use on Registered
Devices as set forth in Section 7.2 (Ad Hoc Distribution), the distribution of Applications for beta testing
through Apple’s TestFlight Program as set forth in Section 7.3, the distribution of Libraries in accordance
with Section 7.4, the distribution of Passes in accordance with Attachment 5, the delivery of OS X
Website Push Notifications on OS X, and the distribution of Safari Extensions on OS X, no other
distribution of programs or applications developed using the Apple Software is authorized or permitted
hereunder. In the absence of a separate agreement with Apple, You agree not to distribute Your
Application to third parties via other distribution methods or to enable or permit others to do so. You
agree to distribute Your Covered Products only in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
8. Revocation
You understand and agree that Apple may cease distribution of Your Licensed Application(s) and/or
Licensed Application Information or revoke the Apple-issued digital certificates issued to You hereunder
at any time. By way of example only, Apple might choose to do this if at any time:
(a) Any of Your Provisioning Profiles, digital certificates or corresponding private keys has been
compromised or Apple has reason to believe that either has been compromised;
(b) Apple has been notified or otherwise has reason to believe that Your Covered Product violates,
misappropriates, or infringes the rights of a third party or of Apple;
(c) Apple has reason to believe that Your Covered Product contains malicious or harmful code, malware,
programs or other internal components (e.g., software virus);
(d) Apple has reason to believe that Your Covered Product damages, corrupts, degrades, destroys or
otherwise adversely affects the devices it operates on, or any other software, firmware, hardware, data,
systems, or networks accessed or used by such products;
(e) You breach any term or condition of this Agreement or the Registered Apple Developer terms and
conditions;
(f) Any information or documents provided by You to Apple for the purpose of verifying Your identity or
obtaining Provisioning Profiles or Apple-issued digital certificates is false or inaccurate;
(g) Any representation, warranty or certification provided by You to Apple in this Agreement is untrue or
inaccurate;
(h) Apple is required by law, regulation or other governmental or court order to take such action;
(i) You request that Apple take such action in accordance with Schedule 1;
(j) You misuse or overburden any services provided hereunder;

(l) Apple has reason to believe that such action is prudent or necessary.
9. Program Fees
As consideration for the rights and licenses granted to You under this Agreement and Your participation
in the Program, You agree to pay Apple the requisite annual program fees as set forth on the Program
website. The fees are non-refundable. Any taxes that may be levied on the Apple Software or Your use of
it shall be Your responsibility. Your program fees must be paid up and not in arrears at the time You
submit (or resubmit) Applications to Apple under this Agreement, and Your continued use of the Program
web portal is subject to Your payment of such fees.
10. Confidentiality
10.1 Information Deemed Apple Confidential
You agree that all pre-release versions of the Apple Software (including pre-release Documentation) and
services, any terms and conditions contained herein that disclose pre-release features of the Apple
Software or services, the terms and conditions of Schedule 2 (available separately to cover distribution of
paid-for Licensed Applications via the App Store) and the terms and conditions of Schedule 3 (available
Program Agreement Page 23
separately to cover distribution of Custom B2B Applications to VPP Customers via the VPP/B2B Program
Site) will be deemed "Apple Confidential Information"; provided however that upon the commercial
release of the Apple Software the terms and conditions that disclose pre-release features of the Apple
Software or services will no longer be confidential. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Apple Confidential
Information will not include: (i) information that is generally and legitimately available to the public through
no fault or breach of Yours, (ii) information that is generally made available to the public by Apple,
(iii) information that is independently developed by You without the use of any Apple Confidential
Information, (iv) information that was rightfully obtained from a third party who had the right to transfer or
disclose it to You without limitation, or (v) any FOSS included in the Apple Software and accompanied by
licensing terms that do not impose confidentiality obligations on the use or disclosure of such FOSS.
Further, Apple agrees that You will not be bound by the foregoing confidentiality terms with regard to
technical information about pre-release Apple Software and services disclosed by Apple at WWDC
(Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference), except that You may not post screen shots, write public
reviews or redistribute any pre-release Apple Software or services.
10.2 Obligations Regarding Apple Confidential Information
You agree to protect Apple Confidential Information using at least the same degree of care that You use
to protect Your own confidential information of similar importance, but no less than a reasonable degree
of care. You agree to use Apple Confidential Information solely for the purpose of exercising Your rights
and performing Your obligations under this Agreement and agree not to use Apple Confidential
Information for any other purpose, for Your own or any third party’s benefit, without Apple's prior written
consent. You further agree not to disclose or disseminate Apple Confidential Information to anyone other
than: (i) those of Your employees and contractors, or those of Your faculty and staff if You are an
educational institution, who have a need to know and who are bound by a written agreement that
prohibits unauthorized use or disclosure of the Apple Confidential Information; or (ii) except as otherwise
agreed or permitted in writing by Apple. You may disclose Apple Confidential Information to the extent
required by law, provided that You take reasonable steps to notify Apple of such requirement before
disclosing the Apple Confidential Information and to obtain protective treatment of the Apple Confidential
Information. You acknowledge that damages for improper disclosure of Apple Confidential Information
may be irreparable; therefore, Apple is entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and
preliminary injunction, in addition to all other remedies.
10.3 Information Submitted to Apple Not Deemed Confidential
Apple works with many application and software developers and some of their products may be similar to
or compete with Your Applications. Apple may also be developing its own similar or competing
applications and products or may decide to do so in the future. To avoid potential misunderstandings,
Apple cannot agree, and expressly disclaims, any confidentiality obligations or use restrictions, express or
implied, with respect to any information that You may provide in connection with this Agreement or the
Program, including information about Your Application, Licensed Application Information and metadata
(such disclosures will be referred to as “Licensee Disclosures”). You agree that any such Licensee
Disclosures will be non-confidential. Apple will be free to use and disclose any Licensee Disclosures on
an unrestricted basis without notifying or compensating You. You release Apple from all liability and
obligations that may arise from the receipt, review, use, or disclosure of any portion of any Licensee
Disclosures. Any physical materials You submit to Apple will become Apple property and Apple will have
no obligation to return those materials to You or to certify their destruction.
10.4 Press Releases and Other Publicity
You may not issue any press releases or make any other public statements regarding this Agreement, its
terms and conditions, or the relationship of the parties without Apple’s express prior written approval,
which may be withheld at Apple’s discretion.
11. Indemnification
To the extent permitted by applicable law, You agree to indemnify and hold harmless, and upon Apple’s
request, defend, Apple, its directors, officers, employees, independent contractors and agents (each an
"Apple Indemnified Party") from any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, taxes, expenses and
costs, including without limitation, attorneys’ fees and court costs (collectively, "Losses"), incurred by an
Apple Indemnified Party and arising from or related to any of the following: (i) Your breach of any
certification, covenant, obligation, representation or warranty in this Agreement, including Schedule 2 and
Program Agreement Page 24
Schedule 3 (if applicable); (ii) any claims that Your Covered Product or the distribution, sale, offer for sale,
use or importation of Your Covered Product (whether alone or as an essential part of a combination),
Licensed Application Information, metadata, or Pass Information violate or infringe any third party
intellectual property or proprietary rights; (iii) Your breach of any of Your obligations under the EULA (as
defined in Schedule 1 or Schedule 2 or Schedule 3 (if applicable)) for Your Licensed Application; (iv)
Apple’s permitted use, promotion or delivery of Your Licensed Application, Licensed Application
Information, OS X Website Push Notification, Safari Extension (if applicable), Pass, Pass Information,
metadata, related trademarks and logos, or images and other materials that You provide to Apple under
this Agreement, including Schedule 2 or Schedule 3 (if applicable); (v) any claims, including but not
limited to any end-user claims, regarding Your Covered Products, Licensed Application Information, Pass
Information, or related logos, trademarks, content or images; or (vi) Your use (including Your Authorized
Developers’ use) of the Apple Software or services, Your Licensed Application Information, Pass
Information, metadata, Your Authorized Test Devices, Your Registered Devices, Your Covered Products,
or Your development and distribution of any of the foregoing.
You acknowledge that neither the Apple Software nor any services are intended for use in the
development of Covered Products in which errors or inaccuracies in the content, functionality, services,
data or information provided by any of the foregoing or the failure of any of the foregoing, could lead to
death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage, and, to the extent permitted by law,
You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Apple Indemnified Party from any Losses
incurred by such Apple Indemnified Party by reason of any such use.
In no event may You enter into any settlement or like agreement with a third party that affects Apple's
rights or binds Apple in any way, without the prior written consent of Apple.

reviews for Your Application, engaging in payment fraud, etc.).
Apple may also terminate this Agreement, or suspend Your rights to use the Apple Software or services,
if You fail to accept any new Program Requirements or Agreement terms as described in Section 4.
Either party may terminate this Agreement for its convenience, for any reason or no reason, effective 30
days after providing the other party with written notice of its intent to terminate.
12.3 Effect of Termination
Upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason, You agree to immediately cease all use of the
Apple Software and services and erase and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the Apple Software and
any information pertaining to the services (including Your Push Application ID) and all copies of Apple
Program Agreement Page 25
Confidential Information in Your and Your Authorized Developers' possession or control. At Apple’s
request, You agree to provide written certification of such destruction to Apple. Upon the expiration of the
Delivery Period defined and set forth in Schedule 1, all Licensed Applications and Licensed Application

Purchase API. Apple will not be liable for compensation, indemnity, or damages of any sort as a result of
terminating this Agreement in accordance with its terms, and termination of this Agreement will be without

litigation or dispute resolution. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the United States and the State of California, except that body of California law concerning
conflicts of law. Notwithstanding the foregoing:
(a) If You are an agency, instrumentality or department of the federal government of the United
States, then this Agreement shall be governed in accordance with the laws of the United States of
America, and in the absence of applicable federal law, the laws of the State of California will apply.
Further, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including but not limited to

not cause You to violate any applicable law (e.g., the Anti-Deficiency Act), and You have any legally
required authorization or authorizing statute.

determined by arbitration administered by the International Centre for Dispute Resolution in accordance
with its International Arbitration Rules. The place of arbitration shall be London, England; the language
shall be English; and the number of arbitrators shall be three. Upon Apple’s request, You agree to provide

between the parties with respect to the use of the Apple Software licensed hereunder and supersedes all
prior understandings and agreements regarding its subject matter, including the iOS SDK Agreement
(clickwrap) accompanying the iOS SDK. This Agreement may be modified only: (a) by a written
amendment signed by both parties, or (b) to the extent expressly permitted by this Agreement (for
example, by Apple by written or email notice to You). Any translation of this Agreement is done for local
requirements and in the event of a dispute between the English and any non-English version, the English

The following terms are in addition to the terms of the Agreement and apply to any use of the APN (Apple
Push Notification service):
1. Use of the APN and Local Notifications
1.1 You may use the APN only in Your Applications, Your Passes, and/or in sending OS X
Website Push Notifications to the OS X desktop of users of Your Site who have opted in to receive
Notifications through Safari on OS X. You, Your Application and/or Your Pass may access the APN only
via the APN API and only if You have been assigned a Push Application ID by Apple. Except for the
limited purpose of Section 6 below, You agree not to share Your Push Application ID with any third party.
You understand that You will not be permitted to access or use the APN after expiration or termination of
Your Agreement.
1.2 You are permitted to use the APN and the APN APIs only for the purpose of sending Push
Notifications to Your Application or Your Pass on an iOS Product, Apple Watch, and/or to the OS X
desktop of users of Your Site who have opted in to receive Notifications through Safari on OS X as
expressly permitted by the Agreement (including but not limited to this Attachment 1), the APN
Documentation and all applicable laws and regulations (including all intellectual property laws). You
further agree that You must disclose to Apple any use of the APN as part of the submission process for
Your Application.
1.3 You understand that before You send an end-user any Push Notifications through the APN,
the end-user must consent to receive such Notifications. You agree not to disable, override or otherwise
interfere with any Apple-implemented consent panels or any Apple system preferences for enabling or
disabling Notification functionality. If the end-user’s consent to receive Push Notifications is denied or
later withdrawn, You may not send the end-user Push Notifications.
2. Additional Requirements
2.1 You may not use the APN or Local Notifications for the purpose of sending unsolicited
messages to end-users or for the purpose of phishing or spamming, including, but not limited to,
engaging in any types of activities that violate anti-spamming laws and regulations, or that are otherwise
improper, inappropriate or illegal. For example, You agree not to include links to phishing or other
malicious websites in Your OS X Website Push Notifications.
2.2 You may not use the APN or Local Notifications for the purposes of advertising, product
promotion, or direct marketing of any kind (e.g., up-selling, cross-selling, etc.), including, but not limited
to, sending any messages to promote the use of Your Application or advertise the availability of new
features or versions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, You may use the APN or Local Notifications for
promotional purposes in connection with Your Pass so long as such use is directly related to the Pass,
e.g., a store coupon may be sent to Your Pass in Passbook.
2.3 You may not excessively use the overall network capacity or bandwidth of the APN, or unduly
burden an iOS Product, Apple Watch, OS X or an end-user with excessive Push Notifications or Local
Notifications, as may be determined by Apple in its reasonable discretion. In addition, You agree not to
harm or interfere with Apple’s networks or servers, or any third party servers or networks connected to the
APN, or otherwise disrupt other developers' use of the APN.
2.4 You may not use the APN or Local Notifications to send material that contains any obscene,
pornographic, offensive or defamatory content or materials of any kind (text, graphics, images,
photographs, sounds, etc.), or other content or materials that in Apple’s reasonable judgment may be
found objectionable by the end-user of Your Application, Pass or Site.
2.5 You may not transmit, store or otherwise make available any material that contains viruses or
any other computer code, files or programs that may harm, disrupt or limit the normal operation of the
Program Agreement Page 31
APN or an iOS Product, Apple Watch, or OS X, and You agree not to disable, spoof, hack or otherwise
interfere with any security, digital signing, verification or authentication mechanisms that are incorporated
in or used by the APN, or enable others to do so.
3. Additional Terms for Website Push IDs
3.1 Subject to the terms of this Agreement, You understand and agree that OS X Website Push
Notifications that You send using Your Website Push ID must be sent under Your own name, trademark
or brand (e.g., a user should know that the communication is coming from Your Site) and must include an
icon, trademark, logo or other identifying mark for Your Site. You agree not to misrepresent or
impersonate another Site or entity or otherwise mislead users about the originator of the OS X Website
Push Notification. To the extent that You reference a third party’s trademark or brand within Your OS X
Website Push Notification, You represent and warrant that You have any necessary rights.
3.2 By enabling the APN and sending OS X Website Push Notifications for Your Site as
permitted in this Agreement, You hereby permit Apple to use (i) screen shots of Your OS X Website Push
Notifications on OS X; and (ii) trademarks and logos associated with such Notifications, for promotional
purposes in Apple’s marketing materials, excluding those portions which You do not have the right to use
for promotional purposes and which You identify in writing to Apple. You also permit Apple to use images
and other materials that You may provide to Apple, at Apple’s reasonable request, for promotional
purposes in marketing materials.
4. Delivery by the APN or via Local Notifications. You understand and agree that in order to
provide the APN and make Your Push Notifications available on iOS Products, Apple Watch, or OS X,
Apple may transmit Your Push Notifications across various public networks, in various media, and modify
or change Your Push Notifications to comply with the technical and other requirements for connecting to
networks or devices. You acknowledge and agree that the APN is not, and is not intended to be, a
guaranteed or secure delivery service, and You shall not use or rely upon it as such. Further, as a
condition to using the APN or delivering Local Notifications, You agree not to transmit sensitive personal
or confidential information belonging to an individual (e.g., a social security number, financial account or
transactional information, or any information where the individual may have a reasonable expectation of
secure transmission) as part of any such Notification, and You agree to comply with any applicable notice
or consent requirements with respect to any collection, transmission, maintenance, processing or use of
an end-user’s personal information.
5. Your Acknowledgements. You acknowledge and agree that:
5.1 Apple may at any time, and from time to time, with or without prior notice to You (a) modify
the APN, including changing or removing any feature or functionality, or (b) modify, deprecate, reissue or
republish the APN APIs. You understand that any such modifications may require You to change or
update Your Applications, Passes or Sites at Your own cost. Apple has no express or implied obligation
to provide, or continue to provide, the APN and may suspend or discontinue all or any portion of the APN
at any time. Apple shall not be liable for any losses, damages or costs of any kind incurred by You or any
other party arising out of or related to any such service suspension or discontinuation or any such
modification of the APN or APN APIs.
5.2 The APN is not available in all languages or in all countries and Apple makes no
representation that the APN is appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent
You choose to access and use the APN, You do so at Your own initiative and are responsible for
compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to any local laws.
5.3 Apple provides the APN to You for Your use with Your Application, Pass, or Site, and does
not provide the APN directly to any end-user. You acknowledge and agree that any Push Notifications
are sent by You, not Apple, to the end-user of Your Application, Pass or Site, and You are solely liable
and responsible for any data or content transmitted therein and for any such use of the APN. Further,
You acknowledge and agree that any Local Notifications are sent by You, not Apple, to the end-user of
Your Application, and You are solely liable and responsible for any data or content transmitted therein.
Program Agreement Page 32
5.4 Apple makes no guarantees to You in relation to the availability or uptime of the APN and is
not obligated to provide any maintenance, technical or other support for the APN.
5.5 Apple reserves the right to remove Your access to the APN, limit Your use of the APN, or
revoke Your Push Application ID at any time in its sole discretion.
5.6 Apple may monitor and collect information (including but not limited to technical and
diagnostic information) about Your usage of the APN to aid Apple in improving the APN and other Apple
products or services and to verify Your compliance with this Agreement; provided however that Apple will
not access or disclose the content of any Push Notification unless Apple has a good faith belief that such
access or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process or request; (b) enforce the
terms of this Agreement, including investigation of any potential violation hereof; (c) detect, prevent or
otherwise address security, fraud or technical issues; or (d) protect the rights, property or safety of Apple,
its developers, customers or the public as required or permitted by law.
6. Third Party Service Providers. You are permitted to employ or retain a third party (“Service
Provider”) to assist You in accessing and using the APN in Your Applications, Passes or Sites, including,
but not limited to, engaging any such Service Provider to maintain and administer Your Applications’
servers on Your behalf, provided any such Service Provider’s access to and use of the APN is only done
on Your behalf in providing such services to You for Your Application, Your Pass and/or Your Sites and in
accordance with these terms, and is subject to a binding written agreement between You and the Service
Provider with terms at least as restrictive and protective of Apple as those set forth herein, including, but
not limited to, confidentiality for pre-release versions of the APN and indemnity obligations to Apple. Any
actions undertaken by any such Service Provider in relation to Your Push Notifications and/or arising out
of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been taken by You, and You (in addition to the Service
Provider) shall be responsible to Apple for all such actions (or any inactions), including but not limited to
indemnifying Apple against any harm caused by the Service Provider acting on Your behalf. In the event
of any actions or inactions that would constitute a violation of this Agreement or otherwise cause any
harm, Apple reserves the right to require You to change Service Providers.

OR LOSSES ARISING FROM ANY USE OF THE APN, INCLUDING ANY INTERRUPTIONS TO THE

(to the Agreement)
Additional Terms for Use of the In-App Purchase API
The following terms are in addition to the terms of the Agreement and apply to any use of the In-App
Purchase API in Your Application:
1. Use of the In-App Purchase API
1.1 You may use the In-App Purchase API only to enable end-users to access or receive content,
functionality, or services that You make available for use within Your Application (e.g., digital books,
additional game levels, access to a turn-by-turn map service). You may not use the In-App Purchase API
to offer goods or services to be used outside of Your Application.
1.2 You must submit to Apple for review and approval all content, functionality, or services that
You plan to provide through the use of the In-App Purchase API in accordance with these terms and the
processes set forth in Section 6 of the Agreement. For all submissions, You must provide the name, text
description, price, unique identifier number, and other information that Apple reasonably requests
(collectively, the “Submission Description”). Apple reserves the right to review the actual content,
functionality or service that has been described in the Submission Descriptions at any time, including, but
not limited to, in the submission process and after approval of the Submission Description by Apple. If
You would like to provide additional content, functionality or services through the In-App Purchase API
that are not described in Your Submission Description, then You must first submit a new or updated
Submission Description for review and approval by Apple prior to making such items available through
the use of the In-App Purchase API. Apple reserves the right to withdraw its approval of content,
functionality, or services previously approved, and You agree to stop making any such content,
functionality, or services available for use within Your Application.
1.3 All content, functionality, and services offered through the In-App Purchase API are subject to
the Program Requirements for Applications, and after such content, services or functionality are added to
a Licensed Application, they will be deemed part of the Licensed Application and will be subject to all the
same obligations and requirements. For clarity, Applications that provide keyboard extension functionality
may not use the In-App Purchase API within the keyboard extension itself; however, they may continue to
use the In-App Purchase API in separate areas of the Application.
2. Additional Restrictions
2.1 You may not use the In-App Purchase API to enable an end-user to set up a pre-paid
account to be used for subsequent purchases of content, functionality, or services, or otherwise create
balances or credits that end-users can redeem or use to make purchases at a later time.
2.2 You may not enable end-users to purchase Currency of any kind through the In-App
Purchase API, including but not limited to any Currency for exchange, gifting, redemption, transfer,
trading or use in purchasing or obtaining anything within or outside of Your Application. “Currency”
means any form of currency, points, credits, resources, content or other items or units recognized by a
group of individuals or entities as representing a particular value and that can be transferred or circulated
as a medium of exchange.
2.3 Content and services may be offered through the In-App Purchase API on a subscription
basis (e.g., subscriptions to newspapers and magazines). Rentals of content, services or functionality
through the In-App Purchase API are not allowed (e.g., use of particular content may not be restricted to
a pre-determined, limited period of time).
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.3.9 of the Agreement, if Your Licensed Application is content
based (e.g., magazines and newspapers) and offered on an auto-renewing subscription basis through the
use of the In-App Purchase API, You may collect certain user data (e.g., user name, email address, zip
code), provided that You clearly and conspicuously notify the user of Your privacy policy and that its
terms will govern the ways that You may use such information, and further provided that the user
Program Agreement Page 34
consents to Your collection and use prior to gathering such data. You agree to maintain, and strictly
comply with the terms of, Your privacy policy.
2.4 You may not use the In-App Purchase API to send any software updates to Your Application
or otherwise add any additional executable code to Your Application. An In-App Purchase item must
either already exist in Your Application waiting to be unlocked, be streamed to Your Application after the
In-App Purchase API transaction has been completed, or be downloaded to Your Application solely as
data after such transaction has been completed.
2.5 You may not use the In-App Purchase API to deliver any items that contain content or
materials of any kind (text, graphics, images, photographs, sounds, etc.) that in Apple’s reasonable
judgment may be found objectionable or inappropriate, for example, materials that may be considered
obscene, pornographic, or defamatory.
2.6 With the exception of items of content that an end-user consumes or uses up within Your
Application (e.g., virtual supplies such as construction materials) (a “Consumable”), any other content,
functionality, services or subscriptions delivered through the use of the In-App Purchase API (e.g., a
sword for a game) (a “Non-Consumable”) must be made available to end-users in accordance with the
same usage rules as Licensed Applications (e.g., any such content, services or functionality must be
available to all of the devices associated with an end-user’s account). You will be responsible for
identifying Consumable items to Apple and for disclosing to end-users that Consumables will not be
available for use on other devices.
3. Your Responsibilities
3.1 For each successfully completed transaction made using the In-App Purchase API, Apple will
provide You with a transaction receipt. It is Your responsibility to verify the validity of such receipt prior to
the delivery of any content, functionality, or services to an end-user and Apple will not be liable for Your
failure to verify that any such transaction receipt came from Apple.
3.2 Unless Apple provides You with user interface elements, You are responsible for developing
the user interface Your Application will display to end-users for orders made through the In-App Purchase
API. You agree not to misrepresent, falsely claim, mislead or engage in any unfair or deceptive acts or
practices regarding the promotion and sale of items through Your use of the In-App Purchase API,
including, but not limited to, in the Licensed Application Information and any metadata that You submit
through iTunes Connect. You agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including those in
any jurisdictions in which You make content, functionality, services or subscriptions available through the
use of the In-App Purchase API, including but not limited to consumer laws and export regulations.
3.3 Apple may provide hosting services for Non-Consumables that You would like to provide to
Your end-users through the use of the In-App Purchase API. Even if Apple hosts such Non-Consumables
on Your behalf, You are responsible for providing items ordered through the In-App Purchase API in a
timely manner (i.e., promptly after Apple issues the transaction receipt, except in cases where You have
disclosed to Your end-user that the item will be made available at a later time) and for complying with all
applicable laws in connection therewith, including but not limited to, laws, rules and regulations related to
cancellation or delivery of ordered items. You are responsible for maintaining Your own records for all
such transactions.
3.4 You will not issue any refunds to end-users of Your Application, and You agree that Apple
may issue refunds to end-users in accordance with the terms of Schedule 2.
4. Apple Services
4.1 From time to time, Apple may choose to offer additional services and functionality relating to
In-App Purchase API transactions. Apple makes no guarantees that the In-App Purchase API or any
related services will continue to be made available to You or that they will meet Your requirements, be
uninterrupted, timely, secure or free from error, that any information that You obtain from the In-App
Purchase API or any related services will be accurate or reliable or that any defects will be corrected.
Program Agreement Page 35
4.2 You understand that You will not be permitted to access or use the In-App Purchase API after
expiration or termination of Your Agreement.
5. Your Acknowledgements. You acknowledge and agree that:
5.1 Apple may at any time, and from time to time, with or without prior notice to You (a) modify
the In-App Purchase API, including changing or removing any feature or functionality, or (b) modify,
deprecate, reissue or republish the In-App Purchase API. You understand that any such modifications
may require You to change or update Your Applications at Your own cost in order to continue to use the
In-App Purchase API. Apple has no express or implied obligation to provide, or continue to provide, the
In-App Purchase API or any services related thereto and may suspend or discontinue all or any portion of
thereof at any time. Apple shall not be liable for any losses, damages or costs of any kind incurred by
You or any other party arising out of or related to any suspension, discontinuation or modification of the
In-App Purchase API or any services related thereto.
5.2 Apple provides the In-App Purchase API to You for Your use with Your Application, and may
provide services to You in connection therewith (e.g., hosting services for Non-Consumable items).
Apple is not responsible for providing or unlocking any content, functionality, services or subscriptions
that an end-user orders through Your use of the In-App Purchase API. You acknowledge and agree that
any such items are made available by You, not Apple, to the end-user of Your Application, and You are
solely liable and responsible for such items ordered through the use of the In-App Purchase API and for
any such use of the In-App Purchase API in Your Application or for any use of services in connection
therewith.
5.3 Apple makes no guarantees to You in relation to the availability or uptime of the In-App
Purchase API or any other services that Apple may provide to You in connection therewith, and Apple is
not obligated to provide any maintenance, technical or other support related thereto.
6. Third Party Service Providers. You are permitted to employ or retain a Service Provider to
assist You in delivery of content, functionality, services or subscriptions through the In-App Purchase API
including, but not limited to, engaging any such Service Provider to maintain and administer Your
Applications’ servers on Your behalf, provided any such Service Provider’s access to and use of the InApp
Purchase API is only done on Your behalf in providing such services to You for Your Application and
in accordance with these terms, and is subject to a binding written agreement between You and the
Service Provider with terms at least as restrictive and protective of Apple as those set forth herein,
including, but not limited to, confidentiality for pre-release versions of the Apple Software and indemnity
obligations to Apple. Any actions undertaken by any such Service Provider in relation to Your
Application, Your use of the In-App Purchase API, and/or arising out of this Agreement shall be deemed
to have been taken by You, and You (in addition to the Service Provider) shall be responsible to Apple for
all such actions (or any inactions), including but not limited to indemnifying Apple against any harm
caused by the Service Provider acting on Your behalf. In the event of any actions or inactions that would
constitute a violation of this Agreement or otherwise cause any harm, Apple reserves the right to require
You to change Service Providers.
7. Use of Digital Certificates for In-App Purchase. When an end-user completes a
transaction using the In-App Purchase API in Your Application, Apple will provide You with a transaction
receipt signed with an Apple-issued certificate. It is Your responsibility to verify that such certificate and
receipt were issued by Apple, as set forth in the Documentation. You are solely responsible for Your
decision to rely on any such certificates and receipts. YOUR USE OF OR RELIANCE ON SUCH
CERTIFICATES AND RECEIPTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE IN-APP PURCHASE API IS AT YOUR
SOLE RISK. APPLE MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,

Additional Terms for the Game Center
The following terms are in addition to the terms of the Agreement and apply to any use of the Game
Center service by You or Your Application; provided however that You may only use confidential, prerelease
versions of the Game Center service for testing and development of Your Application and may
not use such pre-release service in Your Licensed Application or disclose it in any way until it is publicly
released by Apple.
1. Use of the Game Center service
1.1 You and Your Application may not connect to or use the Game Center service in any way not
expressly authorized by Apple. You agree to only use the Game Center service in accordance with this
Agreement (including this Attachment 3), the Game Center Documentation and in accordance with all
applicable laws. You understand that neither You nor Your Application will be permitted to access or use
the Game Center service after expiration or termination of Your Agreement.
1.2 Apple may provide You with a unique identifier which is associated with an end-user’s alias
as part of the Game Center service (the “Player ID”). You agree to not display the Player ID to the enduser
or to any third party, and You agree to only use the Player ID for differentiation of end-users in
connection with Your use of the Game Center. You agree not to reverse look-up, trace, relate, associate,
mine, harvest, or otherwise exploit the Player ID, aliases or other data or information provided by the
Game Center service, except to the extent expressly permitted herein. For example, You will not attempt
to determine the real identity of an end-user.
1.3 You will only use information provided by the Game Center service as necessary for
providing services and functionality for Your Applications as well as any Mac App Store applications that
You have associated with Your developer account. For example, You will not host or export any such
information to a third party service. Further, You agree not to transfer or copy any user information or
data (whether individually or in the aggregate) obtained through the Game Center service to a third party
except as necessary for providing services and functionality for Your Applications (and Your Mac App
Store applications), and then only with express user consent and only if not otherwise prohibited in this
Agreement.
1.4 You will not attempt to gain (or enable others to gain) unauthorized use or access to the
Game Center service (or any part thereof) in any way, including but not limited to obtaining information
from the Game Center service using any method not expressly permitted by Apple. For example, You
may not use packet sniffers to intercept any communications protocols from systems or networks
connected to the Game Center, scrape any data or user information from the Game Center, or use any
third party software to collect information through the Game Center about players, game data, accounts,
or service usage patterns.
2. Additional Restrictions
2.1 You agree not to harm or interfere with Apple’s networks or servers, or any third party servers
or networks connected to the Game Center service, or otherwise disrupt other developers' or end-users’
use of the Game Center. You agree that, except for testing and development purposes, You will not
create false accounts through the use of the Game Center service or otherwise use the Game Center
service to misrepresent information about You or Your Application in a way that would interfere with an
end-users’ use of the Game Center service, e.g., creating inflated high scores through the use of cheat
codes or falsifying the number of user accounts for Your Application.
2.2 You will not institute, assist, or enable any disruptions of the Game Center, such as through a
denial of service attack, through the use of an automated process or service such as a spider, script, or
bot, or through exploiting any bug in the Game Center service or Apple Software. You agree not to
probe, test or scan for vulnerabilities in the Game Center service. You further agree not to disable, spoof,
Program Agreement Page 38
hack, undermine or otherwise interfere with any data protection, security, verification or authentication
mechanisms that are incorporated in or used by the Game Center service, or enable others to do so.
2.3 You will not transmit, store or otherwise make available any material that contains viruses or
any other computer code, files or programs that may harm, disrupt or limit the normal operation of the
Game Center or an iOS Product.
2.4 You agree not to use any portion of the Game Center service for sending any unsolicited,
improper or inappropriate messages to end-users or for the purpose of poaching, phishing or spamming
of Game Center users. You will not reroute (or attempt to reroute) users of the Game Center to another
service using any information You obtain through the use of the Game Center service.
2.5 You shall not charge any fees to end-users for access to the Game Center service or for any
data or information provided therein.
2.6 To the extent that Apple permits You to manage certain Game Center features and
functionality for Your Application through iTunes Connect (e.g., the ability to block fraudulent users or
eliminate suspicious leaderboard scores from Your Application’s leaderboard), You agree to use such
methods only when You have a reasonable belief that such users or scores are the result of misleading,
fraudulent, improper, unlawful or dishonest acts.
3. Your Acknowledgements. You acknowledge and agree that:
3.1 Apple may at any time, and from time to time, with or without prior notice to You (a) modify
the Game Center service, including changing or removing any feature or functionality, or (b) modify,
deprecate, reissue or republish the Game Center APIs or related APIs. You understand that any such
modifications may require You to change or update Your Applications at Your own cost. Apple has no
express or implied obligation to provide, or continue to provide, the Game Center service and may
suspend or discontinue all or any portion of the Game Center service at any time. Apple shall not be
liable for any losses, damages or costs of any kind incurred by You or any other party arising out of or
related to any such service suspension or discontinuation or any such modification of the Game Center
service or Game Center APIs.
3.2 As long as the Game Center service is a confidential, pre-release service, You will only allow
it to be used for testing and development purposes by Your Authorized Developers and only for use on
Your Authorized Test Devices, and You will not use any Game Center APIs in Your Licensed
Applications. You agree to restrict access to such Authorized Test Devices in accordance with the terms
of the Agreement.
3.3 Apple makes no guarantees to You in relation to the availability or uptime of the Game
Center service and is not obligated to provide any maintenance, technical or other support for such
service.

diagnostic information) about Your usage of the Game Center service to aid Apple in improving the Game
Center and other Apple products or services and to verify Your compliance with this Agreement.

LOSSES ARISING FROM ANY INTERRUPTIONS TO THE GAME CENTER OR ANY SYSTEM
FAILURES, NETWORK ATTACKS, SCHEDULED OR UNSCHEDULED MAINTENANCE, OR OTHER
INTERRUPTIONS.

Additional Terms for the use of iCloud
The following terms are in addition to the terms of the Agreement and apply to Your use of the iCloud
service for software development and testing in connection with Your Application, any Mac App Store
applications that You have associated with Your developer account, or Multi-Platform Software. If You
receive access to a beta trial for the end-user iCloud service, then Your usage as an end-user of the prerelease
iCloud service will be subject to the terms accompanying such beta trial in addition to the terms of
this Agreement. You may not use the pre-release iCloud Storage APIs, CloudKit APIs or iCloud service in
Your Licensed Applications, Mac App Store applications or Multi-Platform Software until it is publicly
released by Apple.
1. Use of iCloud
1.1 Your Applications, Mac App Store applications, and/or Multi-Platform Software may access
the iCloud service only if You have been assigned an Entitlement by Apple. You agree not to access the
iCloud service, or any content, data or information contained therein, other than through the iCloud
Storage APIs, CloudKit APIs or via the CloudKit dashboard provided as part of the Program. You agree
not to share Your Entitlement with any third party or use it for any purposes not expressly permitted by
Apple. You agree to use the iCloud service, the iCloud Storage APIs, and the CloudKit APIs only as
expressly permitted by this Agreement and the iCloud Documentation, and in accordance with all
applicable laws and regulations.
1.2 You understand that You will not be permitted to access or use the iCloud service for
software development or testing after expiration or termination of Your Agreement; however end-users
who have Your Applications, Mac App Store applications, or Multi-Platform Software installed and who
have a valid end-user account with Apple to use iCloud may continue to access their user-generated
documents, private containers and files that You have chosen to store in such end-user’s account via the
iCloud Storage APIs or the CloudKit APIs in accordance with the applicable iCloud terms and conditions
and these terms. You agree not to interfere with an end-user’s ability to access iCloud (or the end-user’s
own user-generated documents, private containers and files) or to otherwise disrupt their use of iCloud in
any way and at any time. With respect to data You store in public containers through the CloudKit APIs
(whether generated by You or the end-user), Apple reserves the right to suspend access to or delete
such data, in whole or in part, upon expiration or termination of Your Agreement, or as otherwise
specified by Apple in the CloudKit dashboard.
1.3 Your Application is permitted to use the iCloud Storage APIs only for the purpose of storage
and retrieval of key value data (e.g., a list of stocks in a finance App, settings for an App) for Your
Applications and Multi-Platform Software and for purposes of enabling Your end-users to access usergenerated
documents and files through the iCloud service. Your Application or Mac App Store application
is permitted to use the CloudKit APIs for storing, retrieving, and querying of structured data that You
choose to store in public or private containers in accordance with the iCloud Documentation. You agree
not to knowingly store any content or materials via the iCloud Storage APIs or CloudKit APIs that would
cause Your Application to violate any of the iCloud terms and conditions or the Program Requirements for
Your Applications (e.g., Your Application may not store illegal or infringing materials).
1.4 You may allow a user to access their user-generated documents and files from iCloud
through the use of Your Applications as well as from Multi-Platform Software. However, You may not
share key value data from Your Application with other Applications or Multi-Platform Software, unless You
are sharing such data among different versions of the same title (e.g., the iPhone version of an
Application can share key value data with an iPad or Mac App Store version of the same titled
Application), or You have user consent.
1.5 You are responsible for any content and materials that You store in iCloud through the use of
the CloudKit APIs and iCloud Storage APIs and must take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect
information You store through the iCloud service. With respect to third party claims related to content and
materials stored by Your end-users in Your Applications through the use of the iCloud Storage APIs or
Program Agreement Page 40
CloudKit APIs (e.g., user-generated documents, end-user posts in public containers), You agree to be
responsible for properly handling and promptly processing any such claims, including but not limited to
Your compliance with notices sent pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).
1.6 Unless otherwise expressly permitted by Apple in writing, You will not use iCloud, the iCloud
Storage APIs, CloudKit APIs, or any component or function thereof, to create, receive, maintain or
transmit any sensitive, individually-identifiable health information, including “protected health
information” (as such term is defined at 45 C.F.R § 160.103), or use iCloud in any manner that would
make Apple (or any Apple Subsidiary) Your or any third party’s “business associate” as such term is
defined at 45 C.F.R. § 160.103. You agree to be solely responsible for complying with any reporting
requirements under law or contract arising from Your breach of this Section.
2. Additional Requirements
2.1 You understand there are storage capacity, transmission, and transactional limits for the
iCloud service, both for You as a developer and for Your end-users. If You reach or Your end-user
reaches such limits, then You or Your end-user may be unable to use the iCloud service until You or Your
end-user have removed enough data from the service to meet the capacity limits, increased storage
capacity or otherwise modified Your usage of iCloud, and You or Your end-user may be unable to access
or retrieve data from iCloud during this time.
2.2 You may not charge any fees to users for access to or use of the iCloud service through Your
Applications, Mac App Store applications or Multi-Platform Software, and You agree not to sell access to
the iCloud service in any other way, including but not limited to reselling any part of the service. You will
only use the iCloud service in Your Application, Mac App Store application, or Multi-Platform Software to
provide storage for an end-user who has a valid end-user iCloud account with Apple and only for use in
accordance with the terms of such user account, except that You may use the CloudKit APIs to store of
data in public containers for access by end-users regardless of whether such users have iCloud
accounts. You will not induce any end-user to violate the terms of their applicable iCloud service
agreement with Apple or to violate any Apple usage policies for data or information stored in the iCloud
service.
2.3 You may not excessively use the overall network capacity or bandwidth of the iCloud service
or otherwise burden such service with unreasonable data loads or queries. You agree not to harm or
interfere with Apple’s networks or servers, or any third party servers or networks connected to the iCloud,
or otherwise disrupt other developers' or users’ use of the iCloud service.
2.4 You will not disable or interfere with any warnings, iOS system settings, notices, or
notifications that are presented to an end-user of the iCloud service by Apple.
3. Your Acknowledgements
You acknowledge and agree that:
3.1 Apple may at any time, with or without prior notice to You (a) modify the iCloud Storage APIs
or the CloudKit APIs, including changing or removing any feature or functionality, or (b) modify,
deprecate, reissue or republish such APIs. You understand that any such modifications may require You
to change or update Your Applications, Mac App Store applications or Multi-Platform Software at Your
own cost. Apple has no express or implied obligation to provide, or continue to provide, the iCloud service
and may suspend or discontinue all or any portion of the iCloud service at any time. Apple shall not be
liable for any losses, damages or costs of any kind incurred by You or any other party arising out of or
related to any such service suspension or discontinuation or any such modification of the iCloud service,
iCloud Storage APIs or the CloudKit APIs.
3.2 The iCloud service is not available in all languages or in all countries and Apple makes no
representation that the iCloud service is appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the
extent You choose to provide access to the iCloud service in Your Applications, Mac App Store
applications, or Multi-Platform Software through the iCloud Storage APIs or CloudKit APIs (e.g., to store
Program Agreement Page 41
data in a public or private container), You do so at Your own initiative and are responsible for compliance
with any applicable laws or regulations.
3.3 Apple makes no guarantees to You in relation to the availability or uptime of the iCloud
service and is not obligated to provide any maintenance, technical or other support for the iCloud service.
Apple is not responsible for any expenditures, investments, or commitments made by You in connection
with the iCloud service, or for any use of or access to the iCloud service.
3.4 Apple reserves the right to suspend or revoke Your access to the iCloud service or impose
limits on Your use of the iCloud service at any time in Apple’s sole discretion. In addition, Apple may
impose or adjust the limit of transactions Your Applications, Mac App Store applications, or Multi-Platform
Software may send or receive through the iCloud service or the resources or capacity that they may use
at any time in Apple’s sole discretion.
3.5 Apple may monitor and collect information (including but not limited to technical and
diagnostic information) about usage of the iCloud service through the iCloud Storage APIs, CloudKit
APIs, or CloudKit dashboard, in order to aid Apple in improving the iCloud service and other Apple
products or services; provided however that Apple will not access or disclose any end-user data stored in
a private container through CloudKit, any Application data stored in a public container through CloudKit,
or any user-generated documents, files or key value data stored using the iCloud Storage APIs and
iCloud service, unless Apple has a good faith belief that such access, use, preservation or disclosure is
reasonably necessary to comply with a legal or regulatory process or request, or unless otherwise
requested by an end-user with respect to data stored via the iCloud Storage APIs in that end-user’s
iCloud account or in that end-user’s private container via the CloudKit APIs.
3.6 Further, to the extent that You store any end-user personal information in the iCloud service
through the use of the iCloud Storage APIs or CloudKit APIs, You agree that Apple (and any applicable
Apple Subsidiary) will act as Your agent for the processing, storage and handling of any such personal
information. You remain responsible at all times for such personal information; however, Apple will
protect such data with the security features outlined in our Privacy Policy, including abiding by Safe
Harbor Programs.

waive any right to collect any purchase price, proceeds or other remuneration for the distribution and
download of such pre-release versions of Your Licensed Application. You further agree that You shall
remain responsible for the payment of any royalties or other payments to third parties relating to the
distribution and user of Your pre-release Licensed Applications, as well as compliance with any and all
laws for territories in which such Beta Testing takes place. For the sake of clarity, no commission shall be
owed to Apple with respect to such distribution.
1.3 The parties acknowledge and agree that their relationship under this Schedule 1 is, and shall
be, that of principal and agent, or principal and commissionaire, as the case may be, as described in
Exhibit A, Section 1 and Exhibit A, Section 2 respectively, and that You, as principal, are, and shall be,

to Your end-users, subsections 1.2(b), (c), and (d) of this Schedule 1 shall survive termination or
expiration of the Agreement unless You indicate otherwise pursuant to sections 4.1 and 6.2 of this
Schedule 1.
1.5 All of the Licensed Applications delivered by You to Apple under Section 2.1 of this Schedule 1
shall be made available by Apple for download by end-users at no charge. Apple shall have no duty to
collect any fees for the Licensed Applications for any end-user and shall have no payment obligation to
You with respect to any of those Licensed Applications under this Schedule 1. In the event that You

have previously entered) into a separate agreement (Schedule 2) with Apple with respect to that Licensed
Application.
2. Delivery of the Licensed Applications to Apple
2.1 You will deliver to Apple, at Your sole expense, using the iTunes Connect site or other
mechanism provided by Apple, the Licensed Applications, Licensed Application Information and
associated metadata, in a format and manner prescribed by Apple, as required for the delivery of the
Licensed Applications to end-users in accordance with this Schedule 1. Metadata You deliver to Apple

(ii) the countries You designate, in which You wish Apple to allow end-users to download those Licensed
Applications; (iii) any copyright or other intellectual property rights notices; (iv) Your privacy policy, if any;

2.3 You hereby certify that all of the Licensed Applications You deliver to Apple under this
Schedule 1 are authorized for export from the United States to each of the countries designated by You
Program Agreement Page 48
under Section 2.1 hereof, in accordance with the requirements of all applicable laws, including but not
limited to the United States Export Administration Regulations, 15 C.F.R. Parts 730-774 and the
International Traffic in Arms Regulations 22 C.F.R. Parts 120-130. Without limiting the generality of this
Section 2.3, You certify that (i) none of the Licensed Applications contains, uses or supports any data
encryption or cryptographic functions; or (ii) in the event that any Licensed Application contains, uses or
supports any such data encryption or cryptographic functionality, You certify that You have complied with
the United States Export Administration Regulations, and are in possession of, and will, upon request,
provide Apple with a PDF copy of Your Encryption Registration Number (ERN), or export classification
ruling (CCATS) issued by the United States Commerce Department, Bureau of Industry and Security and
PDF copies of appropriate authorizations from other countries that mandate import authorizations for that
Licensed Application, as required. You acknowledge that Apple is relying upon Your certification in this
Section 2.3 in allowing end-users to access and download the Licensed Applications under this Schedule
1. Except as provided in this Section 2.3, Apple will be responsible for compliance with the requirements
of the Export Administration Regulations in allowing end-users to access and download the Licensed
Applications under this Schedule 1.
3. Ownership and End-User Licensing and Delivery of the Licensed Applications to End
Users
3.1 You acknowledge and agree that Apple, in the course of acting as agent for You, is hosting,
or pursuant to Section 1.2(b) of this Schedule 1 may enable authorized third parties to host, the Licensed
Application(s), and is allowing the download of those Licensed Application(s) by end-users, on Your
behalf. However, You are responsible for hosting and delivering content or services sold or delivered by
You using the In-App Purchase API, except for content that is included within the Licensed Application
itself (i.e., the In-App Purchase simply unlocks the content) or content hosted by Apple pursuant to
Section 3.3 of Attachment 2 of the Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree that Apple shall not
acquire any ownership interest in or to any of the Licensed Applications or Licensed Applications
Information, and title, risk of loss, responsibility for, and control over the Licensed Applications shall, at all
times, remain with You. Apple may not use any of the Licensed Applications or Licensed Application
Information for any purpose, or in any manner, except as specifically authorized in the Agreement or this
Schedule 1.
3.2 You may deliver to Apple Your own EULA for any Licensed Application at the time that You
deliver that Licensed Application to Apple, in accordance with Section 2.1 of this Schedule 1; provided,
however, that Your EULA must include and may not be inconsistent with the minimum terms and
conditions specified on Exhibit B to this Schedule 1 and must comply with all applicable laws in all
countries where You wish Apple to allow end-users to download that Licensed Application. Apple shall
enable each end-user to review Your EULA (if any) at the time that Apple delivers that Licensed
Application to that end-user, and Apple shall notify each end-user that the end-user’s use of that Licensed
Application is subject to the terms and conditions of Your EULA (if any). In the event that You do not
furnish Your own EULA for any Licensed Application to Apple, You acknowledge and agree that each
end-user’s use of that Licensed Application shall be subject to Apple’s standard EULA (which is part of
the App Store Terms of Service).
3.3 You hereby acknowledge that the EULA for each of the Licensed Applications is solely
between You and the end-user and conforms to applicable law, and Apple shall not be responsible for,
and shall not have any liability whatsoever under, any EULA or any breach by You or any end-user of any
of the terms and conditions of any EULA.
3.4 A Licensed Application may read or play content (magazines, newspapers, books, audio,
music, video) that is offered outside of the Licensed Application (such as, by way of example, through
Your website) provided that You do not link to or market external offers for such content within the
Licensed Application. You are responsible for authentication access to content acquired outside of the
Licensed Application.
3.5 You may offer in-app subscriptions for free in select territories using the In-App Purchase API
subject to the terms of this Schedule 1, provided that the Licensed Application is Newsstand-enabled
pursuant to section 3.7 below and You clearly and conspicuously disclose to users the following
Program Agreement Page 49
information regarding Your in-app subscription:
• Title of publication or service
• Subscription may be discontinued at any time by removing app from device
• Links to Your Privacy Policy and Terms of Use
3.6 To the extent you promote and offer in-app subscriptions, You must do so in compliance with
all legal and regulatory requirements.
3.7 If Your Licensed Application is periodical content-based (e.g., magazines and newspapers),
Apple may provide You with the name, email address, and zip code associated with an end-user’s
account when they request an auto-renewing subscription via the In-App Purchase API, provided that
such user consents to the provision of data to You, and further provided that You may only use such data
to promote Your own products and do so in strict compliance with Your publicly posted Privacy Policy, a
copy of which must be readily viewed and is consented to in Your Licensed Application.
3.8 Licensed Applications offering subscription services under this Schedule 1 must be included
in Apple’s Newsstand program provided that, in addition to the requirements set forth in paragraphs 3.5,
3.6 and 3.7, You:
• Enable the Licensed Application as a Newsstand app in the iTunes Connect tool
• Authorize Apple to select “Newsstand” as the Licensed Application’s secondary category
• Utilize the In-App Purchase API, include any additional code, and comply with any other
requirements as identified and updated from time to time in Newsstand-related documentation
found in the iOS developer library and the iTunes Connect Developer Guide
• Provide updated cover art with each new issue
• Confirm that the content of the Licensed Application is a periodical (e.g., newspaper or magazine)
You acknowledge and agree that Apple reserves the right to recategorize or reject your Licensed
Application if it is not appropriate for Newsstand.
4. Content Restrictions and Software Rating
4.1 You represent and warrant that: (a) You have the right to enter into this Agreement, to
reproduce and distribute each of the Licensed Applications, and to authorize Apple to permit end-users to
download and use each of the Licensed Applications through one or more App Stores; (b) none of the
Licensed Applications, or Apple’s or end-users’ permitted uses of those Licensed Applications, violate or
infringe any patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property or contractual rights of
any other person, firm, corporation or other entity and that You are not submitting the Licensed
Applications to Apple on behalf of one or more third parties; (c) each of the Licensed Applications is
authorized for distribution, sale and use in, export to, and import into each of the countries designated by
You under Section 2.1 of this Schedule 1, in accordance with the laws and regulations of those countries
and all applicable export/import regulations; (d) none of the Licensed Applications contains any obscene,
offensive or other materials that are prohibited or restricted under the laws or regulations of any of the
countries You designate under Section 2.1 of this Schedule 1; (e) all information You provide using the
iTunes Connect tool, including any information relating to the Licensed Applications, is accurate and that,
if any such information ceases to be accurate, You will promptly update it to be accurate using the iTunes
Connect tool; and (f) in the event a dispute arises over the content of Your Licensed Applications or use
of Your intellectual property on the App Store, You agree to follow Apple’s app dispute process on a nonexclusive
basis and without any party waiving its legal rights.
4.2 You shall use the software rating tool set forth on iTunes Connect to supply information
regarding each of the Licensed Applications delivered by You for marketing and fulfillment by Apple
through the App Store under this Schedule 1 in order to assign a rating to each such Licensed
Application. For purposes of assigning a rating to each of the Licensed Applications, You shall use Your
best efforts to provide correct and complete information about the content of that Licensed Application
with the software rating tool. You acknowledge and agree that Apple is relying on: (i) Your good faith
and diligence in accurately and completely providing the requested information for each Licensed
Program Agreement Page 50
Application; and (ii) Your representations and warranties in Section 4.1 hereof, in making that Licensed
Application available for download by end-users in each of the countries You designate hereunder.
Furthermore, You authorize Apple to correct the rating of any Licensed Application of Yours that has been
assigned an incorrect rating; and You agree to any such corrected rating.
4.3 In the event that any country You designate hereunder requires the approval of, or rating of,
any Licensed Application by any government or industry regulatory agency as a condition for the
distribution and/or use of that Licensed Application, You acknowledge and agree that Apple may elect not
to make that Licensed Application available for download by end-users in that country from any App
Store.
5. Responsibility and Liability
5.1 Apple shall have no responsibility for the installation and/or use of any of the Licensed
Applications by any end-user. You shall be solely responsible for any and all product warranties, enduser
assistance and product support with respect to each of the Licensed Applications.
5.2 You shall be solely responsible for, and Apple shall have no responsibility or liability
whatsoever with respect to, any and all claims, suits, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses
arising from, or attributable to, the Licensed Applications and/or the use of those Licensed Applications by
any end-user, including, but not limited to: (i) claims of breach of warranty, whether specified in the EULA
or established under applicable law; (ii) product liability claims; and (iii) claims that any of the Licensed
Applications and/or the end-user’s possession or use of those Licensed Applications infringes the
copyright or other intellectual property rights of any third party.
6. Termination
6.1 This Schedule 1, and all of Apple’s obligations hereunder, shall terminate upon the expiration
or termination of the Agreement.
6.2 In the event that You no longer have the legal right to distribute the Licensed Applications, or
to authorize Apple to allow access to those Licensed Applications by end-users, in accordance with this
Schedule 1, You shall promptly notify Apple and withdraw those Licensed Applications from the App
Store using the tools provided on the iTunes Connect site; provided, however, that such withdrawal by
You under this Section 6.2 shall not relieve You of any of Your obligations to Apple under this Schedule 1,
or any liability to Apple and/or any end-user with respect to those Licensed Applications.
6.3 Apple reserves the right to cease allowing download by end-users of the Licensed
Applications at any time, with or without cause, by providing notice of termination to You. Without limiting
the generality of this Section 6.3, You acknowledge that Apple may cease allowing download by endusers
of some or all of the Licensed Applications, or take other interim measures in Apple’s sole
discretion, if Apple reasonably believes that: (i) those Licensed Applications are not authorized for export
to one or more of the countries designated by You under Section 2.1 hereof, in accordance with the
Export Administration Regulations; (ii) those Licensed Applications and/or any end-user’s possession
and/or use of those Licensed Applications, infringe patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret or other
intellectual property rights of any third party; (iii) the distribution and/or use of those Licensed Applications
violates any applicable law in any country You designate under Section 2.1 of this Schedule 1; or (iv) You
have violated the terms of the Agreement, this Schedule 1, or other documentation including without
limitation the iOS App Review Guidelines. An election by Apple to cease allowing download of any
Licensed Applications, pursuant to this Section 6.3, shall not relieve You of Your obligations under this
Schedule 1.
6.4 You may withdraw any or all of the Licensed Applications from the App Store, at any time,
and for any reason, by using the tools provided on the iTunes Connect site, except that, with respect to
Your end-users, You hereby authorize and instruct Apple to fulfill sections 1.2(b), (c), and (d) of this
Schedule 1, which shall survive termination or expiration of the Agreement unless You indicate otherwise
pursuant to sections 4.1 and 6.2 of this Schedule 1.
