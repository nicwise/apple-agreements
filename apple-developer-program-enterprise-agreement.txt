content, services, information or data or use any robot, spider, site search or other retrieval
application or device to scrape, mine, retrieve, cache, analyze or index software, data or services
provided by Apple or its licensors, or obtain (or try to obtain) any such data, except the data that
Apple expressly provides or makes available to You in connection with such services. You agree
that You will not collect, disseminate or use information about Your users for any unauthorized
purpose.
- If Your Internal Use Application is intended for human subject research, then You agree to
inform participants of the intended uses and disclosures of their personally identifiable data as
part of such research and to obtain consent from such participants (or their guardians) who will be
using Your Internal Use Application for such research purposes. Further, You shall prohibit third
parties to whom you provide any de-identified or coded data from re-identifying (or attempting to
re-identify) any participants using such data without participant consent, and You agree to require
that such third parties pass the foregoing restriction on to any other parties who receive such deidentified
or coded data.
Advertising Identifier:
3.3.12 You and Your Internal Use Applications (and any third party with whom you have
contracted to serve advertising) may use the Advertising Identifier, and any information obtained
through the use of the Advertising Identifier, only for the purpose of serving advertising. If a user

Limited Advertising Purposes.
Location and Maps; User Consents:
3.3.14 For Internal Use Applications that use location-based APIs (e.g., Core Location, Map
Kit API) or otherwise provide location-based services, such Internal Use Applications may not be
Enterprise Agreement Page 13
designed or marketed for automatic or autonomous control of vehicle behavior, or for emergency
or life-saving purposes. In addition, Internal Use Applications that offer location-based services
or functionality must notify and obtain consent from an individual before his or her location data is
collected, transmitted or otherwise used by the Internal Use Application.
3.3.15 If You choose to provide Your own location-based service, data and/or information in
conjunction with the Apple maps provided through the Apple Maps Service (e.g., overlaying a
map or route You have created on top of an Apple map), You are solely responsible for ensuring
that Your service, data and/or information correctly aligns with any Apple maps used. For Internal
Use Applications that use location-based APIs for real-time navigation (including, but not limited
to, turn-by-turn route guidance and other routing that is enabled through the use of a sensor), You
must have an end-user license agreement that includes the following notice: YOUR USE OF
THIS REAL TIME ROUTE GUIDANCE APPLICATION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. LOCATION

3.3.17 If Your Internal Use Application uses or accesses the Map Kit API from a device
running iOS version 6 or later, Your Internal Use Application will access and use the Apple Maps
Service. All use of the Map Kit API and Apple Maps Service will be in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement (including the Program Requirements) and Attachment 5 (Additional Terms for
the use of the Apple Maps Service). If Your Internal Use Application uses or accesses the Map
Kit API from a device running iOS version 5 or earlier, Your Internal Use Application will access
and use the Google Mobile Maps (GMM) service. Such use of the GMM Service is subject to
Google’s Terms of Service which are set forth
at: http://code.google.com/apis/maps/terms/iPhone.html. If You do not accept such Google
Terms of Service, including, but not limited to all limitations and restrictions therein, You may not
use the GMM service in Your Internal Use Application, and You acknowledge and agree that
such use will constitute Your acceptance of such Terms of Service.

Watch, or other software, firmware, hardware, data, systems, services, or networks.
3.3.22 If Your Internal Use Application includes any FOSS, You agree to comply with all
applicable FOSS licensing terms. You also agree not to use any FOSS in the development of
Your Internal Use Application in such a way that would cause the non-FOSS portions of the Apple
Software to be subject to any FOSS licensing terms or obligations.
3.3.23 Your Internal Use Application may include promotional sweepstake or contest
functionality provided that You are the sole sponsor of the promotion and that You and Your
Internal Use Application comply with any applicable laws and fulfill any applicable registration
requirements in the country or territory where You make such application available and the
promotion is open. You agree that You are solely responsible for any promotion and any prize,
and also agree to clearly state in binding official rules for each promotion that Apple is not a
sponsor of, or responsible for conducting, the promotion.
3.3.24 Your Internal Application may include a direct link to a page on Your web site where
you include the ability for an end-user to make a charitable contribution, provided that You comply
with any applicable laws (which may include providing a receipt), and fulfill any applicable

bodies such as the FAA, HHS, FTC, and FCC, and the laws, regulations and policies of any
other applicable regulatory bodies in any countries or territories where Your Internal Use
Application is made available, e.g. MHRA, CFDA. However, You agree that You will not seek
any regulatory permissions or make any determinations that may result in any Apple products
being deemed regulated or that may impose any obligations or limitations on Apple. You
represent and warrant that You will fully comply with any applicable laws, regulations, and
policies, including but not limited to all FDA laws, regulations and policies, related to the use of
Your Internal Use Application in the United States, as well as in other countries or territories
where You plan to make Your Internal Use Application available in accordance with the terms and

bandwidth.
3.3.28 Because some mobile network operators may prohibit or restrict the use of Voice
over Internet Protocol (VoIP) functionality over their network, such as the use of VoIP telephony
over a cellular network, and may also impose additional fees, or other charges in connection with
VoIP, You agree to inform Your Employees and/or Permitted Users, prior to use, to check the
terms of agreement with their operator. In addition, if Your Internal Use Application allows such
parties to send SMS messages, then You must inform such users, prior to use of such
functionality, that standard text messaging rates or other carrier charges may apply to such use.
APN (Apple Push Notification service) or Local Notifications:
3.3.29 All use of Push Notifications via the APN or Local Notifications must be in

Additional Services or End-User Pre-Release Software:
3.3.33 From time to time, Apple may provide access to additional services or pre-release
Apple Software for You to use in connection with Your Internal Use Applications, or as an enduser
for evaluation purposes. Some of these may be subject to separate terms and conditions in
addition to this Agreement, in which case Your usage will also be subject to those terms and
conditions. Such services or software may not be available in all languages or in all countries,
and Apple makes no representation that they will be appropriate or available for use in any
particular location. To the extent You choose to access such services or software, You do so at
Your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws, including but not
Enterprise Agreement Page 16
limited to applicable local laws. To the extent any such software includes Apple’s FaceTime or
Messages feature, You acknowledge and agree that when You use such features, the telephone
numbers and device identifiers associated with Your Authorized Test Devices, as well as email
addresses and/or Apple ID information You provide, may be used and maintained by Apple to
provide and improve such software and features. Certain services made accessible to You
through the Apple Software may be provided by third parties. You acknowledge that Apple will not
have any liability or responsibility to You or any other person (including to any end-user) for any
third-party services or for any Apple services. Apple and its licensors reserve the right to change,
suspend, remove, or disable access to any services at any time. In no event will Apple be liable

of the Twitter API, and You acknowledge and agree that such use will constitute Your acceptance
of such terms of service.
3.3.35 If Your Internal Use Application accesses data from an end-user’s Address Book
through the Address Book API, You must notify and obtain consent from the user before his or
her Address Book data is accessed or used by Your Internal Use Application. Further, Your
Internal Use Application may not provide an automated mechanism that transfers only the
Facebook Data portions of the end-user’s Address Book altogether to a location off of the enduser’s
device. For the sake of clarity, this does not prohibit an automated transfer of the user’s
entire Address Book as a whole, so long as user notification and consent requirements have
been fulfilled; and does not prohibit enabling users to transfer any portion of their Address Book
data manually (e.g., by cutting and pasting) or enabling them to individually select particular data
items to be transferred.
Extensions, WatchKit Extensions and Keyboard extensions:
3.3.36 Internal Use Applications that include extensions in the Internal Use Application
bundle must provide some functionality beyond just the extensions (e.g., help screens, additional

prior to any such data being sent from an iOS Product, and notwithstanding anything else in
Section 3.3.9, such data may be used only for purposes of providing or improving the keyboard
functionality of Your Internal Use Application (e.g., not for serving advertising).
Enterprise Agreement Page 17
HealthKit APIs
3.3.37 Your Internal Use Application must not access the HealthKit APIs unless it is
primarily designed to provide health and/or fitness services, and this usage is clearly evident in
Your marketing text and user interface. In addition:
- Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 3.3.9, You and Your Internal Use
Application may not use the HealthKit APIs, or any information obtained through the HealthKit
APIs, for any purpose other than providing health and/or fitness services in connection with Your
Internal Use Application (e.g., not for serving advertising).
- You must not use the HealthKit APIs, or any information obtained through the HealthKit APIs, to
disclose or provide an end-user’s health and/or fitness information to a third party without express
end-user consent, and then only for purposes of enabling the third party to provide health and/or
fitness services. For example, You must not share or sell an end-user’s health information
collected through the HealthKit APIs to advertising platforms, data brokers or information
resellers. For clarity, You may allow end-users to consent to share their data with third parties for
medical research purposes.
- You agree to clearly disclose to end-users how You and Your Internal Use Application will be
using their health and/or fitness information and to use it only as expressly consented to by the
end-user and as expressly permitted herein.

therein, You may not use such NikeFuel points information in Your Application, and You
acknowledge and agree that such use will constitute Your acceptance of such terms of service.
HomeKit APIs:
3.3.39 Your Internal Use Application must not access the HomeKit APIs unless it is primarily
designed to provide home configuration or home automation services (e.g., turning on a light,
lifting a garage door) for Licensed HomeKit Accessories and this usage is clearly evident in Your
marketing text and user interface. You agree not to use the HomeKit APIs for any purpose other
than interfacing, communicating, interoperating with or otherwise controlling a Licensed HomeKit
Accessory or for using the HomeKit Database, and then only for home configuration or home
automation purposes in connection with Your Internal Use Application.
- Your Internal Use Application may use information obtained from the HomeKit APIs and/or the
HomeKit Database only on an iOS Product and may not export, remotely access or transfer such
information off a device (e.g., a lock password cannot be sent off an end-user’s device to be
stored in an external non-Apple database).
- Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 3.3.9, You and Your Internal Use
Application may not use the HomeKit APIs, or any information obtained through the HomeKit
APIs or through the HomeKit Database, for any purpose other than providing or improving home
configuration or home automation services in connection with Your Internal Use Application (e.g.,
not for serving advertising).
4. Changes to Program Requirements or Terms
Apple may change the Program Requirements or the terms of this Agreement at any time. New or
modified Program Requirements will not retroactively apply to Internal Use Applications already in
deployment. In order to continue using the Apple Software or any services, You must accept and
agree to the new Program Requirements and/or new terms of this Agreement. If You do not
Enterprise Agreement Page 18
agree to new Program Requirements or new terms, Your use of the Apple Software and any
services will be suspended or terminated by Apple. You agree that Your acceptance of such new
Agreement terms or Program Requirements may be signified electronically, including without
limitation, by Your checking a box or clicking on an “agree” or similar button. Nothing in this
Section shall affect Apple's rights under Section 8 below.
5. Digital Signing; Restrictions on Certificates and Provisioning
Profiles
5.1 Certificate Requirements
All Internal Use Applications must be signed with an Apple-issued certificate in order to be
installed on Deployment Devices. All Passes must be signed with a Pass Type ID to be
recognized and accepted by Passbook, and for Your Sites, You must use a Website ID to send
OS X Website Push Notifications to the OS X Desktop of users who have opted in to receive such
Notifications through Safari on OS X. All Safari Extensions must be signed with an Apple-issued
certificate to run in Safari on OS X.
During the Term of this Agreement, You may obtain development-related digital certificates from
Apple, subject to a maximum number as reasonably determined by Apple, that will allow Your
Internal Use Application and Your Pass to be installed and tested on Your Authorized Test

and (h) You will use the Apple-issued certificates exclusively for the purpose of signing Your
Internal Use Applications for testing and internal deployment within Your company, organization
or educational institution or as otherwise expressly permitted hereunder, and only in accordance
with this Agreement.
You further represent and warrant to Apple that the licensing terms governing Your Internal Use
Application, Your Safari Extension, Your Site’s registration bundle and/or Your Pass, or governing
any third party code or FOSS included therein, will be consistent with and not conflict with the
digital signing aspects of the Program or any of the terms, conditions or requirements of the
Program or this Agreement. In particular, such licensing terms will not purport to require Apple (or
its agents) to disclose or make available any of the keys, authorization codes, methods,
procedures, data or other information related to the digital signing mechanisms utilized as part of
Enterprise Agreement Page 19
the Program. If You discover any such inconsistency or conflict, You agree to immediately notify
Apple of it and will cooperate with Apple to resolve such matter.

Internal Use Applications:
Internal Use Applications developed under this Agreement may be deployed on Deployment
Devices in two ways: (1) deployment for internal use by Employees or Permitted Users, and (2)
deployment for use by Customers either on Your own or Your Permitted Entity’s physical
premises, or under the direct supervision and physical control of Your Employees or Permitted
Users in other locations, subject to Apple’s right to review and approve such deployment as set
forth herein.
6.1 General
You agree to be solely responsible for determining which Employees and Permitted Users should
have access to and use of Your Internal Use Applications and Deployment Devices, and for
managing and monitoring their use of and access to such Applications and Devices on an
ongoing basis (and/or requiring Your Permitted Entity to monitor such access and use on an
ongoing basis). This includes, without limitation, responsibility for promptly retrieving Deployment

Apple-issued digital certificates and Provisioning Profiles by, individuals who are no longer
employed or engaged by Your company or who are no longer a part of Your Permitted Entity’s
organization or institution.
By deploying Your Internal Use Applications or authorizing Your Permitted Entity to deploy such
Applications on Your behalf, You represent and warrant to Apple that Your Internal Use
Applications comply with the Documentation and Program Requirements then in effect and that
such Internal Use Applications are only being developed and deployed as expressly permitted
herein. Apple shall not be responsible for any costs, expenses, damages, losses (including
without limitation lost business opportunities or lost profits) or other liabilities You may incur as a
result of deploying Your Internal Use Applications, or for Your failure to adequately manage,
monitor, limit or otherwise control the access to and use of Your Internal Use Applications and
Deployment Devices. You will be fully responsible for any violations of the terms of this
Agreement by Your Permitted Entity, Your Employees, Your Permitted Users, Your Customers
Enterprise Agreement Page 20
and any contractors that You may employ to develop such Internal Use Applications on Your
behalf.
6.2 Internal Use Applications used by Permitted Users and Customers
You understand and agree that Apple reserves the right to review and approve or reject any
Internal Use Application that You would like to deploy for use by Your Customers (or that is
already in use by Your Customers) at any time during the Term of this Agreement as well as any
Internal Use Application that You would like to provide for use by Your Permitted Users. If
requested by Apple, You agree to fully cooperate with Apple and promptly provide such Internal
Use Application to Apple. You agree not to attempt to hide, misrepresent, mislead, or obscure
any features, content, services or functionality in Your submitted Internal Use Applications from
Apple's review or otherwise hinder Apple from being able to fully review such Applications.

and at any time, even if Your Internal Use Application meets the Documentation and Program
Requirements; and, in that event, You agree that You may not deploy such Internal Use
Application.
6.3 Ownership of Internal Use Applications; Usage Terms; Liability
You will retain Your right, title and interest in and to Your Internal Use Applications. You will be
responsible for attaching or otherwise including, at Your discretion, any relevant usage terms with
Your Internal Use Application. Apple will not be responsible for any violations of Your usage
terms. You will be solely responsible for all user assistance, warranty and support of Your
Internal Use Applications. The fact that Apple may have reviewed, tested, or approved of an
Internal Use Application, if applicable, will not relieve You of any of these responsibilities.
Apple shall not be responsible for any costs, expenses, damages, losses (including without
limitation lost business opportunities or lost profits) or other liabilities You may incur as a result of
Your Internal Use Application development, use of this Apple Software, use of any services, or
participation in the Program, including without limitation the fact that Your Internal Use Application

10. Confidentiality
10.1 Information Deemed Apple Confidential
You agree that all pre-release versions of the Apple Software (including pre-release
Documentation) and services, the MDM Protocol (including the GM version thereof), and any
terms and conditions contained herein that disclose pre-release features of the Apple Software or
services will be deemed “Apple Confidential Information”; provided however that upon the
commercial release of the Apple Software or services the terms and conditions that disclose prerelease
features of the Apple Software or services will no longer be confidential. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Apple Confidential Information will not include: (i) information that is generally and
legitimately available to the public through no fault or breach of Yours, (ii) information that is
generally made available to the public by Apple, (iii) information that is independently developed
by You without the use of any Apple Confidential Information, (iv) information that was rightfully
obtained from a third party who had the right to transfer or disclose it to You without limitation, or

impose confidentiality obligations on the use or disclosure of such FOSS. Further, Apple agrees
that You will not be bound by the foregoing confidentiality terms with regard to technical
information about pre-release Apple Software and services disclosed by Apple at WWDC
(Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference), except that You may not post screen shots, write

10.2 Obligations Regarding Apple Confidential Information
Enterprise Agreement Page 22
You agree to protect Apple Confidential Information using at least the same degree of care that
You use to protect Your own confidential information of similar importance, but no less than a
reasonable degree of care. You agree to use Apple Confidential Information solely for the
purpose of exercising Your rights and performing Your obligations under this Agreement and
agree not to use Apple Confidential Information for any other purpose, for Your own or any third
party’s benefit, without Apple's prior written consent. You further agree not to disclose or
disseminate Apple Confidential Information to anyone other than: (i) those of Your employees and
contractors, or those of Your faculty and staff if You are an educational institution, who have a
need to know and who are bound by a written agreement that prohibits unauthorized use or
disclosure of the Apple Confidential Information; or (ii) except as otherwise agreed or permitted in
writing by Apple. You may disclose Apple Confidential Information to the extent required by law,
provided that You take reasonable steps to notify Apple of such requirement before disclosing the
Apple Confidential Information and to obtain protective treatment of the Apple Confidential
Information. You acknowledge that damages for improper disclosure of Apple Confidential
Information may be irreparable; therefore, Apple is entitled to seek equitable relief, including
injunction and preliminary injunction, in addition to all other remedies.
10.3 Information Submitted to Apple Not Deemed Confidential
Apple works with many application and software developers and some of their products may be
similar to or compete with Your Internal Use Applications. Apple may also be developing its own
similar or competing applications and products or may decide to do so in the future. To avoid
potential misunderstandings, Apple cannot agree, and expressly disclaims, any confidentiality
obligations or use restrictions, express or implied, with respect to any information that You may
provide in connection with this Agreement or the Program, including information about Your
Internal Use Application and metadata (such disclosures will be referred to as “Licensee
Disclosures”). You agree that any such Licensee Disclosures will be non-confidential. Apple will
be free to use and disclose any Licensee Disclosures on an unrestricted basis without notifying or
compensating You. You release Apple from all liability and obligations that may arise from the
receipt, review, use, or disclosure of any portion of any Licensee Disclosures. Any physical
materials You submit to Apple will become Apple property and Apple will have no obligation to
return those materials to You or to certify their destruction.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Apple, and upon Apple’s request, defend Apple, its directors, officers, employees, independent
contractors and agents (each an "Apple Indemnified Party") from any and all claims, losses,

Your Covered Product, including, but not limited to, a breach of any of Your obligations under any
end-user license that You include for Your Covered Product; (iv) Your use of the Apple Software,
certificates or services (including, but not limited to, the MDM Service and certificates), Your

be liable for any losses, damages or costs of any kind incurred by You or any other party arising
out of or related to any such service suspension or discontinuation or any such modification of the
APN or APN APIs.
5.2 The APN is not available in all languages or in all countries and Apple makes no
representation that the APN is appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the
extent You choose to access and use the APN, You do so at Your own initiative and are
responsible for compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to any local laws.
5.3 Apple provides the APN to You for Your use with Your Internal Use Application, Your

Additional Terms for the MDM Service
The following terms are in addition to the terms of the Agreement and apply to Your use of the
MDM Service.
1. Use of the MDM Service
1.1 You may only use the MDM Service for Your own internal, in-house management of
Your Employees’ or Your Permitted Users’ Deployment Devices, or, if You are selected by Apple
as a third-party MDM developer, solely to provide access to the MDM Service to Your MDM
Customers as part of a Compatible Product. You or Your MDM Customer may only use the MDM
Service with an MDM Profile that is configured to respond to the MDM Certificate that has been
assigned to You or such Customer for Your Compatible Products. All use of the MDM Service is
only permitted as expressly authorized by Apple in this Agreement and the MDM Protocol and
Documentation and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. You understand that
neither You nor Your MDM Customer will be permitted to access or use the MDM Service after
expiration or termination of Your Agreement; provided however that Your MDM Customer may
continue to use the MDM Service if they enter into a separate MDM Service agreement with
Apple.
1.2 You are only permitted to access or use the MDM Service for purposes of managing
Your Employees’ or Permitted Users’ Deployment Devices or, if You are selected by Apple as a
third-party MDM developer, for purposes of developing Compatible Products for distribution and
use by Your MDM Customers. You understand that an MDM Profile must be installed on each
iOS Product before the use of the MDM Service with any such Product. You may distribute the
MDM Profile to iOS Products or OS X Products using email or a web page, over the air
distribution, through the use of Apple-provided installation utilities or through Compatible
Products. You may remove any MDM Profiles that You have installed at any time.
1.3 To use the MDM Service, You must maintain a secure server to interact with Apple’s
APN and/or other Apple web services, and You agree that all communications between You and
Apple’s APN and/or other Apple web services and the MDM Service must be in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement. You may not excessively use the overall network capacity or
bandwidth of such servers or services as may be determined by Apple in its reasonable
discretion. In addition, You agree not to harm or interfere with Apple’s networks or servers, any
third party networks or servers connected to the APN, other Apple web services, or the MDM
Service, or otherwise disrupt the use of any of the foregoing.
1.4 Apple makes no guarantees to You in relation to the availability or uptime of the
MDM Service or other Apple web services and is not obligated to provide any maintenance,
technical or other support for the MDM Service or other Apple web services. Apple does not
guarantee that communications to Deployment Devices, MDM Customers’ iOS Products,
Customer’s OS X Products, or Compatible Products through the use of the MDM Service will be
uninterrupted or error free. Further, network conditions as well as an Employee’s or MDM
Customer’s use of an iOS Product and/or OS X Product may result in delays in commands or
responses.
1.5 Apple reserves the right to not provide You with the MDM Protocol and
Documentation, to require You to return to Apple and cease all use of the MDM Protocol and
Documentation, and to remove Your access to the MDM Service and revoke Your MDM
Certificate (and any MDM Signing Certificate provided to You) at any time in its sole discretion.
You agree that the MDM Protocol is Apple Confidential Information. Except as expressly set forth
herein, You will not share materials or documentation provided by Apple as a part of the MDM
Service (including the MDM Protocol) with any third party, and You will only use the MDM Service
and MDM Protocol as expressly permitted herein. Except as expressly authorized herein, You
Enterprise Agreement Page 33
agree not to sell, resell, lease, or otherwise provide the MDM Service, in whole or in part, to a
third party or attempt to create a substitute or similar service through use of, or access to, the
MDM Service, or use the MDM Service with products other than iOS Products and/or OS X
Products.
1.6 Apple shall not be responsible for any costs, expenses, damages, losses (including
without limitation lost business opportunities or lost profits) or other liabilities You may incur as a
result of any use of the MDM Service by You, including but not limited to any in-house
deployment or any use by Your MDM Customers in connection with Your Compatible Products.
2. Additional Requirements For In-House Deployment
2.1 If You are using the MDM Service for Your own in-house deployment, You agree to
inform Your Employees and/or Permitted Users prior to installation of the MDM Profiles, that You
will be able to interact with their Deployment Devices remotely, including but not limited to by
inspecting, installing or removing profiles, viewing which Applications are installed, using secure
erase functions, and enforcing device passcodes. As a condition to using the MDM Protocol for
such purposes, you represent and warrant to Apple that you have all the necessary rights and
consents to collect, use and manage any information you obtain through the use of the MDM
Protocol in this manner.
2.2 You may not use the MDM Service for the purpose of monitoring Your Employees,
Your Permitted Users, or any Deployment Devices in an undisclosed way or for phishing,
harvesting or otherwise collecting unauthorized information, including, but not limited to, engaging
in any activity that violates user privacy, or that is improper, inappropriate or illegal.
2.3 You may not use the MDM Service in any way to transmit, incorporate or otherwise
make available any material that contains viruses or any other computer code, files or programs
that may harm, disrupt or limit the normal operation of the MDM Service. Further, You agree not
to disable, spoof, hack or otherwise interfere with any security, certificate verification or
authentication mechanism incorporated in or used by the MDM Service, or enable others to do
so.
2.4 If You are using the MDM Service for in-house deployment, then all information that
You obtain through the use of the MDM Service may only be used for Your internal information
technology and device management purposes (e.g., locking the device for security purposes,
remotely wiping a lost device, etc.). For example, You and Your Service Provider are prohibited
from aggregating Your device data with another company’s device data or using it for any
purpose other than Your own internal information technology and device management purposes.
You must treat all such information in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations
(including privacy and data collection laws).
3. Additional Requirements for Compatible Products
3.1 Except as otherwise set forth in Section 2, You may only use the MDM Service for
purposes of developing and distributing Compatible Products to Your MDM Customers if You
have been selected by Apple as a third-party developer for such Compatible Products. You may
not use the MDM Service, in whole or in part, to provide Compatible Products to consumers or
individuals for non-commercial, personal use. Further, You may not license, sell or otherwise
provide the MDM Service, in whole or in part, independent from its use within a Compatible
Product. For example, You may not charge separate fees to Your MDM Customers for use of the
MDM Service, nor may You sell access to the MDM Service apart from bundling it with Your
Compatible Product.
3.2 You agree that Your Compatible Products that use the MDM Service may not be
designed or marketed to monitor end-users or iOS Products or OS X Products in any
Enterprise Agreement Page 34
unauthorized way, e.g., such Compatible Products may not phish, harvest or engage in activities
that violate user privacy, or that are otherwise improper, inappropriate or illegal.
3.3 You agree that Your Compatible Products may not disable, spoof, hack or otherwise
interfere with any security, certificate verification or authentication mechanism incorporated in or
used by the MDM Service, or enable others to do so. Further, neither You nor Your Compatible
Products will knowingly transmit, incorporate or otherwise make available any material that
contains viruses or any other computer code, files or programs that may harm, disrupt or limit the
normal operation of the MDM Service.
3.4 Except as otherwise set forth herein, all information that You obtain through the use
of the MDM Service may only be used to develop or deploy Compatible Products for Your MDM
Customers. You may not share information obtained through the use of the MDM Service with
any third parties (except for Service Providers acting on Your behalf) in accordance with Section
6 of this Attachment 2. For example, neither You nor Your Service Provider may aggregate data
from multiple MDM Customers’ Compatible Products in order to post which iOS versions or iOS
applications are most widely deployed by MDM Customers on a public website, etc.
4. Certificate Usage for Compatible Products
4.1 You understand that Your MDM Customers must obtain an MDM Certificate from
Apple prior to any use of the MDM Service in Your Compatible Products. Your MDM Customers
can apply for such Certificates if You have signed their certificate-signing request (CSR), whether
manually or automatically. Apple will provide You with an MDM Signing Certificate to enable You
to sign such CSRs. You agree to inform Your MDM Customers of this requirement and to provide
adequate support and documentation in connection therewith.
4.2 You agree to only sign CSRs for MDM Customers of Your Compatible Products and
only if such MDM Customers have provided You with, and You have verified, their company
name and individual contact information. You agree to provide such information to Apple upon
Apple’s request and to cooperate with Apple in connection with their use of the MDM Service.
You understand that Apple may require You to contact such company, e.g., if there is a problem
with their use of the MDM Service or application for an MDM Certificate.
4.3 Apple reserves the right to revoke or disable Your MDM Signing Certificate and Your
MDM Customers’ MDM Certificates in its sole discretion.
4.4 You agree to only use Your MDM Signing Certificate as set forth herein. For
avoidance of doubt, You may not provide, share or transfer Your MDM Signing Certificate to any
other entity, including Your MDM Customers or any of Your resellers. You may not include such
MDM Signing Certificate within Your Compatible Product. You agree to take appropriate
measures to safeguard the security and privacy of such Certificate. For the avoidance of doubt,
You may use the MDM Protocol to develop Your Compatible Product to assist Your MDM
Customers in the process of generating keys and sending a CSR to You for signing with Your
MDM Signing Certificate. You may not generate or have any access to Your MDM Customer's
private key, and You may not interfere with Apple’s processes for providing MDM Certificates to
Your MDM Customers. Further, You will not induce any end-user to violate the terms of the MDM
Certificate service agreement with Apple or to violate any Apple usage policies for use of the
MDM Service or any Apple certificates.
4.5 You are solely responsible for providing Your MDM Customers with support and
assistance for the use of MDM Service in Your Compatible Products, including but not limited to
any documentation and end-user customer support and warranties.
5. Your Acknowledgements: You acknowledge and agree that:
Enterprise Agreement Page 35
5.1 Apple may at any time, and from time to time, with or without prior notice to You (a)
modify the MDM Service, including changing or removing any feature or functionality, or (b)
modify, reissue or republish the MDM Protocol. You understand that any such modifications may
require You to change or update Your servers, MDM Profiles, Compatible Products and use of
the MDM Service at Your own cost. Apple has no express or implied obligation to provide, or
continue to provide, the MDM Service and may suspend or discontinue all or any portion of the
MDM Service at any time. Apple shall not be liable for any losses, damages or costs of any kind
incurred by You or any other party arising out of or related to any such service suspension or
discontinuation or any such modification of the MDM Service or any part thereof.
5.2 The MDM Service is not available in all languages or in all countries and Apple
makes no representation that the MDM Service is appropriate or available for use in any

limited to any local laws.
5.3 Apple provides the MDM Service to You for Your use in mobile device management
and information technology for Your Employees, Permitted Users or for use in Compatible
Products by MDM Customers. Apple does not provide the MDM Service directly to any end-user.
You acknowledge and agree that any MDM Profiles that are sent via the MDM Service are sent
by You, not Apple, to authorized iOS Products and/or OS X Products, and You are solely liable
and responsible for Your use of the MDM Service by You, Your Employees, and Your Permitted
Users, or by You and Your MDM Customers.
5.4 Apple makes no guarantees to You in relation to the availability of the MDM Service
and is not obligated to provide any maintenance, technical or other support for the MDM Service.

sole discretion. If Apple removes Your access, then You will lose the ability to use the MDM
Service to manage Deployment Devices and iOS Products configured to work with Your MDM
Certificate, including the ability to remotely wipe such devices.
6. Third-Party Service Providers. You are permitted to use a Service Provider only if
the Service Provider’s access to and use of the MDM Service is done on Your behalf and in
accordance with these terms, and is subject to a binding written agreement between You and the
Service Provider with terms at least as restrictive and protective of Apple as those set forth
herein, including, but not limited to, confidentiality for pre-release versions of the MDM Service
and indemnity obligations to Apple. Any actions undertaken by any such Service Provider in
relation to the MDM Service and/or arising out of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been
taken by You, and You (in addition to the Service Provider) shall be responsible to Apple for all
such actions (or any inactions), including but not limited to indemnifying Apple against any harm
caused by the Service Provider acting on Your behalf. In the event of any actions or inactions by
Your Service Provider that would constitute a violation of this Agreement or otherwise cause any
harm, Apple reserves the right to require You to cease using such Service Provider in connection
with this Agreement.
7. Additional Liability Disclaimer. APPLE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY
DAMAGES OR LOSSES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE MDM
SERVICE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY SCHEDULED OR UNSCHEDULED
MAINTENANCE, SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS, LOST OR STOLEN DATA, ANY LIABILITY
FROM YOUR ACCESS TO DEPLOYMENT DEVICES THROUGH THE USE OF THE MDM
SERVICE (INCLUDING ANY PRIVACY VIOLATIONS RELATED THERETO) OR FOR APPLE’S
PERFORMANCE OR FAILURE TO PERFORM UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

to access their user-generated documents, private containers and files that You have chosen to
store in such end-user’s account via the iCloud Storage APIs or the CloudKit APIs in accordance
with the applicable iCloud terms and conditions and these terms. You agree not to interfere with a
user’s ability to access iCloud (or the user’s own user-generated documents, private containers
and files) or to otherwise disrupt their use of the iCloud service in any way and at any time. With
respect to data You store in public containers through the CloudKit APIs (whether generated by
You or the end-user), Apple reserves the right to suspend access to or delete such data, in whole
or in part, upon expiration or termination of Your Agreement, or as otherwise specified by Apple in

the use of the CloudKit APIs and iCloud Storage APIs and must take reasonable and appropriate
steps to protect information You store through the iCloud service. With respect to third party
claims related to content and materials stored by Your end-users in Your Internal Use
Applications through the use of the iCloud Storage APIs or CloudKit APIs (e.g., user-generated
documents, end-user posts in public containers), You agree to be responsible for properly
handling and promptly processing any such claims, including but not limited to Your compliance
with notices sent pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).
1.6 Unless otherwise expressly permitted by Apple in writing, You will not use iCloud, the
iCloud Storage APIs, CloudKit APIs, or any component or function thereof, to create, receive,
maintain or transmit any sensitive, individually-identifiable health information, including “protected
health information” (as such term is defined at 45 C.F.R § 160.103), or use iCloud in any manner
that would make Apple (or any Apple Subsidiary) Your or any third party’s “business associate”
as such term is defined at 45 C.F.R. § 160.103. You agree to be solely responsible for complying
with any reporting requirements under law or contract arising from Your breach of this Section.
2. Additional Requirements
2.1 You understand there are storage capacity, transmission, and transactional limits for
the iCloud service, both for You as a developer and for Your end-users. If You reach or Your
end-user reaches such limits, then You or Your end-user may be unable to use the iCloud service

before they will be loaded into Passbook and that Passes can be removed or transferred by such
users at any time.
